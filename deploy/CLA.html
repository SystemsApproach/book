<h1>Contributor License Agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-license-agreement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Thank you for contributing to COMPUTER NETWORKS: A SYSTEMS
APPROACH (the “Work”). This Agreement between you (the “You”)
and Elsevier Inc. regarding your Contribution to the Work (the
“Contribution”) outlines our respective obligations and rights.</p>
<p>A. You grant to the Publisher a non-exclusive publishing and
distribution license in the Contribution in print, electronic and
all other media (whether now known or later developed), in any
form, in all languages, throughout the world, for the full term
of copyright, and the right to license others to do the same,
effective when the Contribution is accepted for publication.
This license includes the right to enforce the rights granted
hereunder against third parties.</p>
<p>You understand that You have: (i) the same rights to reuse the
Contribution as those allowed to third party users of the Contribution
under the CC-BY License, as well as (ii) the right to use or re-use
portions or excerpts or the Work in other works, for both commercial
and non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The CC BY license allows users to copy, to create extracts, abstracts
and new works from the Contribution, to alter and revise the Contribution
and to make commercial use of the Contribution (including reuse and/or
resale of the Contribution by commercial entities), provided the user
gives appropriate credit (with a link to the formal publication through
the relevant DOI), provides a link to the license, indicates if changes
were made and  the licensor is not represented as endorsing the use
made of the work. The full details of the license are available at
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.</p>
<p>B. You confirm that the Contribution is original to You, except for
any third-party material that is either in the public domain or for
which appropriate permission has been obtained, and You have
the right to grant to the Publisher the rights described above;
You confirm that the Contribution does not contain any material
that infringes any third party rights or is harmful to the user.</p>
<p>C. Should any materials in the Contribution be the work of others,
said materials must be properly credited, and the Contributor agrees
to obtain and pay for any necessary grant of permission for use of
others’ materials.</p>
<p>D. You will disclose in writing to the Publisher all actual and
potential competing interests, both financial and non-financial,
if any in relation to the Contribution.</p>
<p>E. The Contributor authorizes use by the Publisher and its applicable
affiliates, licensees and service providers worldwide of the Contributor’s
name, image, likeness, voice, biography, and professional affiliations
(at the Publisher’s discretion) for purposes of advertising, promoting
and publicizing the Work and all updates and derivatives thereof and
the Contributor’s contact details, including postal and email addresses,
for purposes of communicating with the Contributor about the Work
and writing, reviewing, researching or contributing to other relevant
projects with the Publisher.</p>
<p>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of New York (“the Governing State”), without regard to conflict
of law principles, and the parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing State.</p>
