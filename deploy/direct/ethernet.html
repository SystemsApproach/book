<h1>2.6 Multi-Access Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-access-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Developed in the mid-1970s by researchers at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC), the Ethernet eventually became the dominant
local area networking technology, emerging from a pack of competing
technologies. Today, it competes mainly with 802.11 wireless networks
but remains extremely popular in campus networks and data centers. The
more general name for the technology behind the Ethernet is Carrier
Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD).</p>
<p>As indicated by the CSMA name, the Ethernet is a multiple-access
network, meaning that a set of nodes sends and receives frames over a
shared link. You can, therefore, think of an Ethernet as being like a
bus that has multiple stations plugged into it. The “carrier sense” in
CSMA/CD means that all the nodes can distinguish between an idle and a
busy link, and “collision detect” means that a node listens as it
transmits and can therefore detect when a frame it is transmitting has
interfered (collided) with a frame transmitted by another node.</p>
<p>The Ethernet has its roots in an early packet radio network, called
Aloha, developed at the University of Hawaii to support computer
communication across the Hawaiian Islands. Like the Aloha network, the
fundamental problem faced by the Ethernet is how to mediate access to a
shared medium fairly and efficiently (in Aloha, the medium was the
atmosphere, while in the Ethernet the medium was originally a coax
cable). The core idea in both Aloha and the Ethernet is an algorithm
that controls when each node can transmit.</p>
<p>Modern Ethernet links are now largely point to point;
that is, they connect one host to an Ethernet <em>switch</em>, or they
interconnect switches. As a consequence, the “multiple access” algorithm
is not used much in today’s wired Ethernets, but a variant is now used in
wireless networks, such as 802.11 networks (also known as Wi-Fi). Due to
the enormous influence of Ethernet, we chose to describe its classic
algorithm here, and then explain how it has been adapted to Wi-Fi in the
next section. We will also discuss Ethernet switches elsewhere. For now,
we’ll focus on how a single Ethernet link works.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corporation and Intel Corporation joined Xerox to
define a 10-Mbps Ethernet standard in 1978. This standard then formed
the basis for IEEE standard 802.3, which additionally defines a much
wider collection of physical media over which an Ethernet can operate,
including 100-Mbps, 1-Gbps, 10-Gbps, 40-Gbps, and 100-Gbps versions.</p>
<div class="section" id="physical-properties">
<h2>Physical Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ethernet segments were originally implemented using coaxial cable of
length up to 500&nbsp;m. (Modern Ethernets use twisted copper pairs, usually
a particular type known as “Category 5,” or optical fibers, and in some
cases can be quite a lot longer than 500 m.) This cable was similar to
the type used for cable TV. Hosts connected to an Ethernet segment by
tapping into it. A <em>transceiver</em>, a small device directly attached to
the tap, detected when the line was idle and drove the signal when the
host was transmitting. It also received incoming signals. The
transceiver, in turn, connected to an Ethernet adaptor, which was
plugged into the host. This configuration is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-tap"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
39</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Multiple Ethernet segments can be joined together by <em>repeaters</em> (or a
multi-port variant of a repeater, called a <em>hub</em>). A
repeater is a device that forwards digital signals, much like an
amplifier forwards analog signals; repeaters do not understand bits or
frames. No more than four repeaters could be positioned between any pair
of hosts, meaning that a classical Ethernet had a total reach of only
2500&nbsp;m. For example, using just two repeaters between any pair of hosts
supports a configuration similar to the one illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-net-repeat"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 40</span></a>; that is, a segment running down the
spine of a building with a segment on each floor.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 40. </span><span class="caption-text">Ethernet repeater, interconnecting segments to form a larger
collision domain.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Any signal placed on the Ethernet by a host is broadcast over the entire
network; that is, the signal is propagated in both directions, and
repeaters and hubs forward the signal on all outgoing segments.
Terminators attached to the end of each segment absorb the signal and
keep it from bouncing back and interfering with trailing signals. The
original Ethernet specifications used the Manchester encoding scheme
described in an earlier section, while 4B/5B encoding (or the similar
8B/10B) scheme is used today on higher speed Ethernets.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that whether a given Ethernet spans a
single segment, a linear sequence of segments connected by repeaters, or
multiple segments connected in a star configuration, data
transmitted by any one host on that Ethernet reaches all the other
hosts. This is the good news. The bad news is that all these hosts are
competing for access to the same link, and, as a consequence, they are
said to be in the same <em>collision domain</em>. The multi-access part of the
Ethernet is all about dealing with the competition for the link that
arises in a collision domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-protocol">
<h2>Access Protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#access-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now turn our attention to the algorithm that controls access to a
shared Ethernet link. This algorithm is commonly called the Ethernet’s
<em>media access control</em> (MAC). It is typically implemented in hardware on
the network adaptor. We will not describe the hardware <em>per se</em>, but
instead focus on the algorithm it implements. First, however, we
describe the Ethernet’s frame format and addresses.</p>
<div class="section" id="frame-format">
<h3>Frame Format<a class="headerlink" href="#frame-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each Ethernet frame is defined by the format given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-enet-format"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
41</span></a>. The 64-bit preamble allows the receiver to
synchronize with the signal; it is a sequence of alternating 0s and 1s.
Both the source and destination hosts are identified with a 48-bit
address. The packet type field serves as the demultiplexing key; it
identifies to which of possibly many higher-level protocols this frame
should be delivered. Each frame contains up to 1500&nbsp;bytes of data.
Minimally, a frame must contain at least 46&nbsp;bytes of data, even if this
means the host has to pad the frame before transmitting it. The reason
for this minimum frame size is that the frame must be long enough to
detect a collision; we discuss this more below. Finally, each frame
includes a 32-bit CRC. Like the HDLC protocol described in an earlier
section, the Ethernet is a bit-oriented framing protocol. Note that from
the host’s perspective, an Ethernet frame has a 14-byte header: two
6-byte addresses and a 2-byte type field. The sending adaptor attaches
the preamble and CRC before transmitting, and the receiving adaptor
removes them.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 41. </span><span class="caption-text">Ethernet frame format.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="addresses">
<h3>Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each host on an Ethernet—in fact, every Ethernet host in the world—has a
unique Ethernet address. Technically, the address belongs to the
adaptor, not the host; it is usually burned into ROM. Ethernet addresses
are typically printed in a form humans can read as a sequence of six
numbers separated by colons. Each number corresponds to 1 byte of the
6-byte address and is given by a pair of hexadecimal digits, one for
each of the 4-bit nibbles in the byte; leading 0s are dropped. For
example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8:0:2b:e4:b1:2</span></code> is the human-readable representation of
Ethernet address</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">00001000</span>  <span class="mi">00000000</span>  <span class="mi">00101011</span>  <span class="mi">11100100</span>  <span class="mi">10110001</span>  <span class="mi">00000010</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To ensure that every adaptor gets a unique address, each manufacturer of
Ethernet devices is allocated a different prefix that must be prepended
to the address on every adaptor they build. For example, Advanced Micro
Devices has been assigned the 24-bit prefix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">080020</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8:0:20</span></code>).
A given manufacturer then makes sure the address suffixes it produces
are unique.</p>
<p>Each frame transmitted on an Ethernet is received by every adaptor
connected to that Ethernet. Each adaptor recognizes those frames
addressed to its address and passes only those frames on to the host.
(An adaptor can also be programmed to run in <em>promiscuous</em> mode, in
which case it delivers all received frames to the host, but this is not
the normal mode.) In addition to these <em>unicast</em> addresses, an Ethernet
address consisting of all 1s is treated as a <em>broadcast</em> address; all
adaptors pass frames addressed to the broadcast address up to the host.
Similarly, an address that has the first bit set to 1 but is not the
broadcast address is called a <em>multicast</em> address. A given host can
program its adaptor to accept some set of multicast addresses. Multicast
addresses are used to send messages to some subset of the hosts on an
Ethernet (e.g., all file servers). To summarize, an Ethernet adaptor
receives all frames and accepts</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Frames addressed to its own address</li>
<li>Frames addressed to the broadcast address</li>
<li>Frames addressed to a multicast address, if it has been instructed to
listen to that address</li>
<li>All frames, if it has been placed in promiscuous mode</li>
</ul>
<p>It passes to the host only the frames that it accepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transmitter-algorithm">
<h3>Transmitter Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#transmitter-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As we have just seen, the receiver side of the Ethernet protocol is
simple; the real smarts are implemented at the sender’s side. The
transmitter algorithm is defined as follows.</p>
<p>When the adaptor has a frame to send and the line is idle, it transmits
the frame immediately; there is no negotiation with the other adaptors.
The upper bound of 1500&nbsp;bytes in the message means that the adaptor can
occupy the line for only a fixed length of time.</p>
<p>When an adaptor has a frame to send and the line is busy, it waits for
the line to go idle and then transmits immediately. (To be more precise,
all adaptors wait 9.6&nbsp;μs after the end of one frame before beginning to
transmit the next frame. This is true for both the sender of the first
frame as well as those nodes listening for the line to become idle.) The
Ethernet is said to be a <em>1-persistent</em> protocol because an adaptor with
a frame to send transmits with probability&nbsp;1 whenever a busy line goes
idle. In general, a <em>p-persistent</em> algorithm transmits with
probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \le p \le 1\)</span> after a line becomes idle and defers
with probability <em>q = 1 - p</em>. The
reasoning behind choosing a <em>p&lt;1</em> is that there might be multiple
adaptors waiting for the busy line to become idle, and we don’t want all
of them to begin transmitting at the same time. If each adaptor
transmits immediately with a probability of, say, 33%, then up to three
adaptors can be waiting to transmit and the odds are that only one will
begin transmitting when the line becomes idle. Despite this reasoning,
an Ethernet adaptor always transmits immediately after noticing that the
network has become idle and has been very effective in doing&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>To complete the story about <em>p</em>-persistent protocols for the case when
<em>p&lt;1</em>, you might wonder how long a sender that loses the coin flip
(i.e., decides to defer) has to wait before it can transmit. The answer
for the Aloha network, which originally developed this style of
protocol, was to divide time into discrete slots, with each slot
corresponding to the length of time it takes to transmit a full frame.
Whenever a node has a frame to send and it senses an empty (idle) slot,
it transmits with probability <em>p</em> and defers until the next slot with
probability <em>q = 1 - p</em>. If that next slot is also empty, the node again
decides to transmit or defer, with probabilities <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>,
respectively. If that next slot is not empty—that is, some other station
has decided to transmit—then the node simply waits for the next idle
slot and the algorithm repeats.</p>
<p>Returning to our discussion of the Ethernet, because there is no
centralized control it is possible for two (or more) adaptors to begin
transmitting at the same time, either because both found the line to be
idle or because both had been waiting for a busy line to become idle.
When this happens, the two (or more) frames are said to <em>collide</em> on the
network. Each sender, because the Ethernet supports collision detection,
is able to determine that a collision is in progress. At the moment an
adaptor detects that its frame is colliding with another, it first makes
sure to transmit a 32-bit jamming sequence and then stops the
transmission. Thus, a transmitter will minimally send 96&nbsp;bits in the
case of a collision: 64-bit preamble plus 32-bit jamming sequence.</p>
<p>One way that an adaptor will send only 96&nbsp;bits—which is sometimes called
a <em>runt frame</em>—is if the two hosts are close to each other. Had the two
hosts been farther apart, they would have had to transmit longer, and
thus send more bits, before detecting the collision. In fact, the
worst-case scenario happens when the two hosts are at opposite ends of
the Ethernet. To know for sure that the frame it just sent did not
collide with another frame, the transmitter may need to send as many as
512&nbsp;bits. Not coincidentally, every Ethernet frame must be at least
512&nbsp;bits (64&nbsp;bytes) long: 14&nbsp;bytes of header plus 46&nbsp;bytes of data plus
4&nbsp;bytes of CRC.</p>
<p>Why 512&nbsp;bits? The answer is related to another question you might ask
about an Ethernet: Why is its length limited to only 2500&nbsp;m? Why not 10
or 1000&nbsp;km? The answer to both questions has to do with the fact that
the farther apart two nodes are, the longer it takes for a frame sent by
one to reach the other, and the network is vulnerable to a collision
during this time.</p>

</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-worst"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 42</span></a> illustrates the worst-case scenario,
where hosts&nbsp;A
and B are at opposite ends of the network. Suppose host&nbsp;A begins
transmitting a frame at time t, as shown in&nbsp;(a). It takes it one link
latency (let’s denote the latency as d) for the frame to reach host&nbsp;B.
Thus, the first bit of A’s frame arrives at B at time t+d, as shown
in&nbsp;(b). Suppose an instant before host&nbsp;A’s frame arrives (i.e., B still
sees an idle line), host&nbsp;B begins to transmit its own frame. B’s frame
will immediately collide with A’s frame, and this collision will be
detected by host&nbsp;B&nbsp;(c). Host&nbsp;B will send the 32-bit jamming sequence, as
described above. (B’s frame will be a runt.) Unfortunately, host&nbsp;A will
not know that the collision occurred until B’s frame reaches it, which
will happen one link latency later, at time <em>t+2×d</em>, as shown in&nbsp;(d).
Host&nbsp;A must continue to transmit until this time in order to detect the
collision. In other words, host&nbsp;A must transmit for <em>2×d</em> to be sure
that it detects all possible collisions. Considering that a maximally
configured Ethernet is 2500&nbsp;m long, and that there may be up to four
repeaters between any two hosts, the round-trip delay has been
determined to be 51.2&nbsp;μs, which on a 10-Mbps Ethernet corresponds to
512&nbsp;bits. The other way to look at this situation is that we need to
limit the Ethernet’s maximum latency to a fairly small value (e.g.,
51.2&nbsp;μs) for the access algorithm to work; hence, an Ethernet’s maximum
length must be something on the order of 2500&nbsp;m.</p>
<p>Once an adaptor has detected a collision and stopped its transmission,
it waits a certain amount of time and tries again. Each time it tries to
transmit but fails, the adaptor doubles the amount of time it waits
before trying again. This strategy of doubling the delay interval
between each retransmission attempt is a general technique known as
<em>exponential backoff</em>. More precisely, the adaptor first delays either 0
or 51.2&nbsp;μs, selected at random. If this effort fails, it then waits 0,
51.2, 102.4, or 153.6&nbsp;μs (selected randomly) before trying again; this
is k × 51.2 for k=0..3. After the third collision, it waits <em>k × 51.2</em>
for k = 0.2<sup>3</sup> - 1, again selected at random. In general,
the algorithm randomly selects a <em>k</em> between 0 and 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
and waits k × 51.2 μs, where <em>n</em> is the number of collisions
experienced so far. The adaptor gives up after a given number of tries
and reports a transmit error to the host. Adaptors typically retry up to
16&nbsp;times, although the backoff algorithm caps <em>n</em> in the above formula
at&nbsp;10.</p>

<h2>Longevity of Ethernet<a class="headerlink" href="#longevity-of-ethernet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ethernet has been the dominant local area network technology for over 30
years. Today it is typically deployed point-to-point rather than tapping
into a coax cable, it often runs at speeds of 1 or 10 Gbps rather than
10 Mbps, and it allows jumbo packets with up to 9000 bytes of data
rather than 1500 bytes. But, it remains backwards compatible with the
original standard. This makes it worth saying a few words about why
Ethernets have been so successful, so that we can understand the
properties we should emulate with any technology that tries to replace
it.</p>
<p>First, an Ethernet is extremely easy to administer and maintain: There
is no routing or configuration tables to be kept up-to-date, and it is
easy to add a new host to the network. It is hard to imagine a simpler
network to administer. Second, it is inexpensive: cable/fiber is
relatively cheap, and the only other cost is the network adaptor on each
host. Ethernet became deeply entrenched for these reasons, and any
switch-based approach that aspired to displace it required additional
investment in infrastructure (the switches), on top of the cost of each
adaptor. The switch-based variant of Ethernet did eventually succeed in
replacing multi-access Ethernet, but this is primarily because it
could be <em>deployed incrementally</em>—with some hosts connected by
point-to-point links to switches while others remained tapped into
coax and connected to repeaters or hubs—all the while retaining the
simplicity of network administration.</p>
