<h1>2.4 Error Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#error-detection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As discussed in Chapter&nbsp;1, bit errors are sometimes introduced into
frames. This happens, for example, because of electrical interference or
thermal noise. Although errors are rare, especially on optical links,
some mechanism is needed to detect these errors so that corrective
action can be taken. Otherwise, the end user is left wondering why the C
program that successfully compiled just a moment ago now suddenly has a
syntax error in it, when all that happened in the interim is that it was
copied across a network file system.</p>
<p>There is a long history of techniques for dealing with bit errors in
computer systems, dating back to at least the 1940s. Hamming and
Reed-Solomon codes are two notable examples that were developed for use
in punch card readers, when storing data on magnetic disks, and in early
core memories. This section describes some of the error detection
techniques most commonly used in networking.</p>
<p>Detecting errors is only one part of the problem. The other part is
correcting errors once detected. Two basic approaches can be taken when
the recipient of a message detects an error. One is to notify the sender
that the message was corrupted so that the sender can retransmit a copy
of the message. If bit errors are rare, then in all probability the
retransmitted copy will be error free. Alternatively, some types of
error detection algorithms allow the recipient to reconstruct the
correct message even after it has been corrupted; such algorithms rely
on <em>error-correcting codes</em>, discussed below.</p>
<p>One of the most common techniques for detecting transmission errors is a
technique known as the <em>cyclic redundancy check</em> (CRC). It is used in
nearly all the link-level protocols discussed in this chapter. This
section outlines the basic CRC algorithm, but before discussing that
approach, we first describe the simpler <em>checksum</em> scheme used by
several Internet protocols.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind any error detection scheme is to add redundant
information to a frame that can be used to determine if errors have been
introduced. In the extreme, we could imagine transmitting two complete
copies of the data. If the two copies are identical at the receiver,
then it is probably the case that both are correct. If they differ, then
an error was introduced into one (or both) of them, and they must be
discarded. This is a rather poor error detection scheme for two reasons.
First, it sends <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> redundant bits for an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-bit message. Second, many
errors will go undetected—any error that happens to corrupt the same bit
positions in the first and second copies of the message. In general, the
goal of error detecting codes is to provide a high probability of
detecting errors combined with a relatively low number of redundant
bits.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can do a lot better than this simple scheme. In
general, we can provide quite strong error detection capability while
sending only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> redundant bits for an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-bit message,
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is much smaller than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>. On an Ethernet, for
example, a frame carrying up to 12,000&nbsp;bits (1500&nbsp;bytes) of data
requires only a 32-bit CRC code, or as it is commonly expressed, uses
CRC-32. Such a code will catch the overwhelming majority of errors, as
we will see below.</p>
<p>We say that the extra bits we send are redundant because they add no new
information to the message. Instead, they are derived directly from the
original message using some well-defined algorithm. Both the sender and
the receiver know exactly what that algorithm is. The sender applies the
algorithm to the message to generate the redundant bits. It then
transmits both the message and those few extra bits. When the receiver
applies the same algorithm to the received message, it should (in the
absence of errors) come up with the same result as the sender. It
compares the result with the one sent to it by the sender. If they
match, it can conclude (with high likelihood) that no errors were
introduced in the message during transmission. If they do not match, it
can be sure that either the message or the redundant bits were
corrupted, and it must take appropriate action—that is, discarding the
message or correcting it if that is possible.</p>
<p>One note on the terminology for these extra bits. In general, they are
referred to as <em>error-detecting codes</em>. In specific cases, when the
algorithm to create the code is based on addition, they may be called a
<em>checksum</em>. We will see that the Internet checksum is appropriately
named: It is an error check that uses a summing algorithm.
Unfortunately, the word <em>checksum</em> is often used imprecisely to mean any
form of error-detecting code, including CRCs. This can be confusing, so
we urge you to use the word <em>checksum</em> only to apply to codes that
actually do use addition and to use <em>error-detecting code</em> to refer to
the general class of codes described in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="internet-checksum-algorithm">
<h2>Internet Checksum Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#internet-checksum-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our first approach to error detection is exemplified by the Internet
checksum. Although it is not used at the link level, it nevertheless
provides the same sort of functionality as CRCs, so we discuss it here.</p>
<p>The idea behind the Internet checksum is very simple—you add up all the
words that are transmitted and then transmit the result of that sum. The
result is the checksum. The receiver performs the same calculation on
the received data and compares the result with the received checksum. If
any transmitted data, including the checksum itself, is corrupted, then
the results will not match, so the receiver knows that an error
occurred.</p>
<p>You can imagine many different variations on the basic idea of a
checksum. The exact scheme used by the Internet protocols works as
follows. Consider the data being checksummed as a sequence of 16-bit
integers. Add them together using 16-bit ones’ complement arithmetic
(explained below) and then take the ones’ complement of the result. That
16-bit number is the checksum.</p>
<p>In ones’ complement arithmetic, a negative integer (-x) is represented
as the complement of x; that is, each bit of x is inverted. When adding
numbers in ones’ complement arithmetic, a carryout from the most
significant bit needs to be added to the result. Consider, for example,
the addition of -5 and -3 in ones’ complement arithmetic on 4-bit
integers: +5 is 0101, so -5 is 1010; +3 is 0011, so -3 is 1100. If we
add 1010 and 1100, ignoring the carry, we get 0110. In ones’ complement
arithmetic, the fact that this operation caused a carry from the most
significant bit causes us to increment the result, giving 0111, which is
the ones’ complement representation of -8 (obtained by inverting the
bits in 1000), as we would expect.</p>
<p>The following routine gives a straightforward implementation of the
Internet’s checksum algorithm. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">count</span></code> argument gives the length
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">buf</span></code> measured in 16-bit units. The routine assumes that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">buf</span></code>
has already been padded with 0s to a 16-bit boundary.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code ensures that the calculation uses ones’ complement arithmetic
rather than the twos’ complement that is used in most machines. Note the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop. If there is a carry into the
top 16&nbsp;bits of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code>, then we increment <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code> just as in the
previous example.</p>
<p>Compared to our repetition code, this algorithm scores well for using a
small number of redundant bits—only 16 for a message of any length—but
it does not score extremely well for strength of error detection. For
example, a pair of single-bit errors, one of which increments a word and
one of which decrements another word by the same amount, will go
undetected. The reason for using an algorithm like this in spite of its
relatively weak protection against errors (compared to a CRC, for
example) is simple: This algorithm is much easier to implement in
software. Experience has suggested that a checksum of this form was
adequate, but one reason it is adequate is that this checksum is the
last line of defense in an end-to-end protocol. The majority of errors
are picked up by stronger error detection algorithms, such as CRCs, at
the link level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cyclic-redundancy-check">
<h2>Cyclic Redundancy Check<a class="headerlink" href="#cyclic-redundancy-check" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It should be clear by now that a major goal in designing error detection
algorithms is to maximize the probability of detecting errors using only
a small number of redundant bits. Cyclic redundancy checks use some
fairly powerful mathematics to achieve this goal. For example, a 32-bit
CRC gives strong protection against common bit errors in messages that
are thousands of bytes long. The theoretical foundation of the cyclic
redundancy check is rooted in a branch of mathematics called <em>finite
fields</em>. While this may sound daunting, the basic ideas can be easily
understood.</p>
<p>To start, think of an (n+1)-bit message as being represented by an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>
degree polynomial, that is, a polynomial whose highest-order term is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{n}\)</span>. The message is represented by a polynomial by using the
value of each bit in the message as the coefficient for each term in
the polynomial, starting with the most significant bit to represent
the highest-order term. For example, an 8-bit message consisting of
the bits 10011010 corresponds to the polynomial</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[M(x) = (1 \times x^7) + (0 \times x^6) + (0 \times x^5) + (1 \times
x^4 )+ (1 \times x^3) + (0 \times x^2) + (1 \times x^1) + (0 \times x^0)\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[M(x) = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1\]</div>
<p>We can thus think of a sender and a receiver as exchanging polynomials
with each other.</p>
<p>For the purposes of calculating a CRC, a sender and receiver have to
agree on a <em>divisor</em> polynomial, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> is a polynomial of
degree <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>. For example, suppose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1\)</span>.
In this case, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=3\)</span>. The answer to the question “Where did <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>
come from?” is, in most
practical cases, “You look it up in a book.” In fact, the choice of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> has a significant impact on what types of errors can be reliably
detected, as we discuss below. There are a handful of divisor
polynomials that are very good choices for various environments, and the
exact choice is normally made as part of the protocol design. For
example, the Ethernet standard uses a well-known polynomial of
degree&nbsp;32.</p>
<p>When a sender wishes to transmit a message <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M(x)\)</span>
that is n+1&nbsp;bits long, what is actually sent is the (n+1)-bit message
plus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> bits. We call the complete transmitted message, including the
redundant bits, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span>. What we are going to do is contrive to make the
polynomial representing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span> exactly divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>; we explain
how this is achieved below. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span> is transmitted over a link and
there are no errors introduced during transmission, then the receiver
should be able to divide <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> exactly, leaving a remainder
of zero. On the other hand, if some error is introduced into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span>
during transmission, then in all likelihood the received polynomial will
no longer be exactly divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>, and thus the receiver will
obtain a nonzero remainder implying that an error has occurred.</p>
<p>It will help to understand the following if you know a little about
polynomial arithmetic; it is just slightly different from normal integer
arithmetic. We are dealing with a special class of polynomial arithmetic
here, where coefficients may be only one or zero, and operations on the
coefficients are performed using modulo&nbsp;2 arithmetic. This is referred
to as “polynomial arithmetic modulo&nbsp;2.” Since this is a networking book,
not a mathematics text, let’s focus on the key properties of this type
of arithmetic for our purposes (which we ask you to accept on faith):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B(x)\)</span> can be divided by a divisor polynomial
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B(x)\)</span> is of higher degree than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Any polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B(x)\)</span> can be divided once by a divisor
polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B(x)\)</span> is of the same degree as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>The remainder obtained when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B(x)\)</span> is divided by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> is
obtained by performing the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on each pair
of matching coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^3 + 1\)</span> can be divided by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\)</span>
(because they are both of degree 3) and the remainder would be
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \times x^3 + 1 \times x^2 + 0 \times x^1 + 0 \times x^0 = x^2\)</span>
(obtained by XORing the coefficients of each term). In terms of
messages, we could say that 1001 can be divided by 1101 and leaves a
remainder of 0100. You should be able to see that the remainder is just
the bitwise exclusive OR of the two messages.</p>
<p>Now that we know the basic rules for dividing polynomials, we are able
to do long division, which is necessary to deal with longer messages. An
example appears below.</p>
<p>Recall that we wanted to create a polynomial for transmission that is
derived from the original message <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M(x)\)</span>, is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;bits longer than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M(x)\)</span>, and is exactly divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>. We can do this in the
following way:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Multiply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M(x)\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{k}\)</span>; that is, add <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> zeros at the end of the message. Call this zero-extended message <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Divide <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T(x)\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> and find the remainder.</li>
<li>Subtract the remainder from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T(x)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be obvious that what is left at this point is a message that
is exactly divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>. We may also note that the
resulting message consists of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M(x)\)</span> followed by the remainder
obtained in step&nbsp;2, because when we subtracted the remainder (which
can be no more than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;bits long), we were just XORing it with
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> zeros added in step&nbsp;1. This part will become clearer
with an example.</p>
<p>Consider the message <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1\)</span>, or 10011010.  We
begin by multiplying by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^3\)</span>, since our divisor polynomial is
of degree&nbsp;3. This gives 10011010000.  We divide this by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>,
which corresponds to 1101 in this case.  <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-crcalc"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 32</span></a> shows the polynomial long-division operation.  Given the
rules of polynomial arithmetic described above, the long-division
operation proceeds much as it would if we were dividing
integers. Thus, in the first step of our example, we see that the
divisor 1101 divides once into the first four bits of the message
(1001), since they are of the same degree, and leaves a remainder of
100 (1101 XOR 1001). The next step is to bring down a digit from the
message polynomial until we get another polynomial with the same
degree as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>, in this case 1001. We calculate the remainder
again (100) and continue until the calculation is complete. Note that
the “result” of the long division, which appears at the top of the
calculation, is not really of much interest—it is the remainder at the
end that matters.</p>
<p>You can see from the very bottom of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-crcalc"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 32</span></a> that the
remainder of the example calculation is 101. So we know that 10011010000
minus 101 would be exactly divisible by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>, and this is what we
send. The minus operation in polynomial arithmetic is the logical XOR
operation, so we actually send 10011010101. As noted above, this turns
out to be just the original message with the remainder from the long
division calculation appended to it. The recipient divides the received
polynomial by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> and, if the result is 0, concludes that there were
no errors. If the result is nonzero, it may be necessary to discard the
corrupted message; with some codes, it may be possible to <em>correct</em> a
small error (e.g., if the error affected only one bit). A code that
enables error correction is called an <em>error-correcting code</em>&nbsp;(ECC).</p>

<p>Now we will consider the question of where the polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>
comes from. Intuitively, the idea is to select this polynomial so that
it is very unlikely to divide evenly into a message that has errors
introduced into it. If the transmitted message is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span>, we may
think of the introduction of errors as the addition of another
polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(x)\)</span>, so the recipient sees <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x) +
E(x)\)</span>. The only way that an error could slip by undetected would be if
the received message could be evenly divided by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>, and
since we know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(x)\)</span> can be evenly divided by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>,
this could only happen if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(x)\)</span> can be divided evenly by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>. The trick is to pick <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> so that this is very
unlikely for common types of errors.</p>
<p>One common type of error is a single-bit error, which can be expressed
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(x) = x^i\)</span> when it affects bit position <em>i</em>. If we select
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> such that thefirst and the last term (that is, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^k\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^0\)</span> terms) are nonzero, then we already have a two-term
polynomial that
cannot divide evenly into the one term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(x)\)</span>. Such a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> can,
therefore, detect all single-bit errors. In general, it is possible to
prove that the following types of errors can be detected by a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span>
with the stated properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All single-bit errors, as long as the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{k}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{0}\)</span> terms have nonzero coefficients</li>
<li>All double-bit errors, as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> has a factor with at least three terms</li>
<li>Any odd number of errors, as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> contains the factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((x + 1)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We have mentioned that it is possible to use codes that not only detect
the presence of errors but also enable errors to be corrected. Since the
details of such codes require yet more complex mathematics than that
required to understand CRCs, we will not dwell on them here. However, it
is worth considering the merits of correction versus detection.</p>
<p>At first glance, it would seem that correction is always better, since
with detection we are forced to throw away the message and, in general,
ask for another copy to be transmitted. This uses up bandwidth and may
introduce latency while waiting for the retransmission. However, there
is a downside to correction, as it generally requires a greater number
of redundant bits to send an error-correcting code that is as strong
(that is, able to cope with the same range of errors) as a code that
only detects errors. Thus, while error detection requires more bits to
be sent when errors occur, error correction requires more bits to be
sent <em>all the time</em>. As a result, error correction tends to be most
useful when (1)&nbsp;errors are quite probable, as they may be, for example,
in a wireless environment, or (2)&nbsp;the cost of retransmission is too
high, for example, because of the latency involved retransmitting a
packet over a satellite link.</p>
<p>The use of error-correcting codes in networking is sometimes referred to
as <em>forward error correction</em> (FEC) because the correction of errors is
handled “in advance” by sending extra information, rather than waiting
for errors to happen and dealing with them later by retransmission. FEC
is commonly used in wireless networks such as 802.11.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any “burst” error (i.e., sequence of consecutive errored bits) for
which the length of the burst is less than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> bits (Most burst
errors of length greater than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> bits can also be detected.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Six versions of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(x)\)</span> are widely used in link-level protocols. For
example, Ethernet uses CRC-32, which is defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CRC-32 = <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{32} + x^{26} + x^{23} + x^{22} + x^{16} +
x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we note that the CRC algorithm, while seemingly complex, is
easily implemented in hardware using a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-bit shift register
and XOR gates. The number of bits in the shift register equals the
degree of the generator polynomial (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>). <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-crc-hard"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 33</span></a> shows the hardware that would be used for the
generator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\)</span> from our previous example. The message
is shifted in from the left, beginning with the most significant bit
and ending with the string of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> zeros that is attached to the
message, just as in the long division example. When all the bits have
been shifted in and appropriately XORed, the register contains the
remainder—that is, the CRC (most significant bit on the right). The
position of the XOR gates is determined as follows: If the bits in the
shift register are labeled 0 through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k-1\)</span>, left to right, then
put an XOR gate in front of bit <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> if there is a term
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^n\)</span> in the generator polynomial.  Thus, we see an XOR gate in
front of positions 0 and 2 for the generator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^3 + x^2 + x^0\)</span>.</p>
