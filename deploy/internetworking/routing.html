<h1>3.4 Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So far in this chapter we have assumed that the switches and routers
have enough knowledge of the network topology so they can choose the
right port onto which each packet should be output. In the case of
virtual circuits, routing is an issue only for the connection request
packet; all subsequent packets follow the same path as the request. In
datagram networks, including IP networks, routing is an issue for every
packet. In either case, a switch or router needs to be able to look at a
destination address and then to determine which of the output ports is
the best choice to get a packet to that address. As we saw in an earlier
section, the switch makes this decision by consulting a forwarding
table. The fundamental problem of routing is how switches and routers
acquire the information in their forwarding tables.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-forwarding">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">We restate an important distinction, which is often neglected,
between <em>forwarding</em> and <em>routing</em>. Forwarding consists of
receiving a packet, looking up its destination address in a table,
and sending the packet in a direction determined by that table. We
saw several examples of forwarding in the preceding section. It is
a simple and well-defined process performed locally at each node,
and is often referred to as the network’s <em>data plane.</em> Routing is
the process by which forwarding tables are built. It depends on
complex distributed algorithms, and is often referred to as the
network’s <em>control plane.</em>  <a class="reference internal" href="#key-routing-alg"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>While the terms <em>forwarding table</em> and <em>routing table</em> are sometimes
used interchangeably, we will make a distinction between them here. The
forwarding table is used when a packet is being forwarded and so must
contain enough information to accomplish the forwarding function. This
means that a row in the forwarding table contains the mapping from a
network prefix to an outgoing interface and some MAC information, such
as the Ethernet address of the next hop. The routing table, on the other
hand, is the table that is built up by the routing algorithms as a
precursor to building the forwarding table. It generally contains
mappings from network prefixes to next hops. It may also contain
information about how this information was learned, so that the router
will be able to decide when it should discard some information.</p>
<p>Whether the routing table and forwarding table are actually separate
data structures is something of an implementation choice, but there are
numerous reasons to keep them separate. For example, the forwarding
table needs to be structured to optimize the process of looking up an
address when forwarding a packet, while the routing table needs to be
optimized for the purpose of calculating changes in topology. In many
cases, the forwarding table may even be implemented in specialized
hardware, whereas this is rarely if ever done for the routing table.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tab-rtab"><span class="std std-numref">Table 14</span></a> gives an example of a row from a routing
table, which tells us that network prefix 18/8 is to be reached by a

<p>Before getting into the details of routing, we need to remind ourselves
of the key question we should be asking anytime we try to build a
mechanism for the Internet: “Does this solution scale?” The answer for
the algorithms and protocols described in this section is “not so much.”
They are designed for networks of fairly modest size—up to a few hundred
nodes, in practice. However, the solutions we describe do serve as a
building block for a hierarchical routing infrastructure that is used in
the Internet today. Specifically, the protocols described in this
section are collectively known as <em>intradomain</em> routing protocols, or
<em>interior gateway protocols</em> (IGPs). To understand these terms, we need
to define a routing <em>domain</em>. A good working definition is an
internetwork in which all the routers are under the same administrative
control (e.g., a single university campus, or the network of a single
Internet Service Provider). The relevance of this definition will become
apparent in the next chapter when we look at <em>interdomain</em> routing
protocols. For now, the important thing to keep in mind is that we are
considering the problem of routing in the context of small to midsized
networks, not for a network the size of the Internet.</p>
<div class="section" id="network-as-a-graph">
<h2>Network as a Graph<a class="headerlink" href="#network-as-a-graph" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Routing is, in essence, a problem of graph theory. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-graph-route"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 84</span></a> shows a graph representing a network. The nodes of
the graph, labeled A through&nbsp;F, may be hosts, switches, routers, or
networks. For our initial discussion, we will focus on the case where
the nodes are routers. The edges of the graph correspond to the
network links. Each edge has an associated <em>cost</em>, which gives some
indication of the desirability of sending traffic over that link. A
discussion of how edge costs are assigned is given in a later section.</p>
<p>Note that the example networks (graphs) used throughout this chapter
have undirected edges that are assigned a single cost. This is actually
a slight simplification. It is more accurate to make the edges
directed, which typically means that there would be a pair of edges
between each node—one flowing in each direction, and each with its
own edge cost.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-graph-route"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-28-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-28-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-28-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 84. </span><span class="caption-text">Network represented as a graph.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The basic problem of routing is to find the lowest-cost path between
any two nodes, where the cost of a path equals the sum of the costs of
all the edges that make up the path. For a simple network like the one
in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-graph-route"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 84</span></a>, you could imagine just
calculating all the shortest paths and loading them into some
nonvolatile storage on each node. Such a static approach has several
shortcomings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It does not deal with node or link failures.</li>
<li>It does not consider the addition of new nodes or links.</li>
<li>It implies that edge costs cannot change, even though we might
reasonably wish to have link costs change over time (e.g., assigning
high cost to a link that is heavily loaded).</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, routing is achieved in most practical networks by
running routing protocols among the nodes. These protocols provide a
distributed, dynamic way to solve the problem of finding the lowest-cost
path in the presence of link and node failures and changing edge costs.
Note the word <em>distributed</em> in the previous sentence; it is difficult to
make centralized solutions scalable, so all the widely used routing
protocols use distributed algorithms.</p>
<p>The distributed nature of routing algorithms is one of the main reasons
why this has been such a rich field of research and development—there
are a lot of challenges in making distributed algorithms work well. For
example, distributed algorithms raise the possibility that two routers
will at one instant have different ideas about the shortest path to some
destination. In fact, each one may think that the other one is closer to
the destination and decide to send packets to the other one. Clearly,
such packets will be stuck in a loop until the discrepancy between the
two routers is resolved, and it would be good to resolve it as soon as
possible. This is just one example of the type of problem routing
protocols must address.</p>
<p>To begin our analysis, we assume that the edge costs in the network are
known. We will examine the two main classes of routing protocols:
<em>distance vector</em> and <em>link state</em>. In a later section, we return to the
problem of calculating edge costs in a meaningful way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distance-vector-rip">
<h2>Distance-Vector (RIP)<a class="headerlink" href="#distance-vector-rip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind the distance-vector algorithm is suggested by its name.
(The other common name for this class of algorithm is Bellman-Ford,
after its inventors.) Each node constructs a one-dimensional array (a
vector) containing the&nbsp;“distances” (costs) to all other nodes and
distributes that vector to its immediate neighbors. The starting
assumption for distance-vector routing is that each node knows the cost
of the link to each of its directly connected neighbors. These costs may
be provided when the router is configured by a network manager. A link
that is down is assigned an infinite cost.</p>

<p>To see how a distance-vector routing algorithm works, it is easiest to
consider an example like the one depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dvroute"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 85</span></a>. In this example, the cost of each link is set to 1, so
that a least-cost path is simply the one with the fewest hops. (Since
all edges have the same cost, we do not show the costs in the graph.)
We can represent each node’s knowledge about the distances to all
other nodes as a table like <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-dvtab1"><span class="std std-numref">Table 16</span></a>. Note that
each node knows only the information in one row of the table (the one
that bears its name in the left column).  The global view that is
presented here is not available at any single point in the network.</p>
<p>We may consider each row in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-dvtab1"><span class="std std-numref">Table 16</span></a> as a list
of distances from one node to all other nodes, representing the
current beliefs of that node. Initially, each node sets a cost of&nbsp;1 to
its directly connected neighbors and ∞ to all other nodes. Thus, A
initially believes that it can reach B in one hop and that D is
unreachable. The routing table stored at A reflects this set of
beliefs and includes the name of the next hop that A would use to
reach any reachable node. Initially, then, A’s routing table would
look like <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-dvtab2"><span class="std std-numref">Table 17</span></a>.</p>
<span id="tab-dvtab2"></span><table border="1" class="colwidths-auto docutils align-center" id="id6">

<p>The next step in distance-vector routing is that every node sends a
message to its directly connected neighbors containing its personal list
of distances. For example, node F tells node A that it can reach node G
at a cost of&nbsp;1; A also knows it can reach F at a cost of&nbsp;1, so it adds
these costs to get the cost of reaching G by means of F. This total cost
of&nbsp;2 is less than the current cost of infinity, so A records that it can
reach G at a cost of&nbsp;2 by going through F. Similarly, A learns from C
that D can be reached from C at a cost of&nbsp;1; it adds this to the cost of
reaching C (1) and decides that D can be reached via C at a cost of&nbsp;2,
which is better than the old cost of infinity. At the same time, A
learns from C that B can be reached from C at a cost of&nbsp;1, so it
concludes that the cost of reaching B via C is 2. Since this is worse
than the current cost of reaching B (1), this new information is
ignored. At this point, A can update its routing table with costs and
next hops for all nodes in the network. The result is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-dvtab3"><span class="std std-numref">Table 18</span></a>.</p>

<p>In the absence of any topology changes, it takes only a few exchanges
of information between neighbors before each node has a complete
routing table. The process of getting consistent routing information
to all the nodes is called <em>convergence</em>. <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-dvtab4"><span class="std std-numref">Table 19</span></a> shows the final set of costs from each node to all other
nodes when routing has converged.  We must stress that there is no one
node in the network that has all the information in this table—each
node only knows about the contents of its own routing table. The
beauty of a distributed algorithm like this is that it enables all
nodes to achieve a consistent view of the network in the absence of
any centralized authority.</p>

<p>There are a few details to fill in before our discussion of
distance-vector routing is complete. First we note that there are two
different circumstances under which a given node decides to send a
routing update to its neighbors. One of these circumstances is the
<em>periodic</em> update. In this case, each node automatically sends an update
message every so often, even if nothing has changed. This serves to let
the other nodes know that this node is still running. It also makes sure
that they keep getting information that they may need if their current
routes become unviable. The frequency of these periodic updates varies
from protocol to protocol, but it is typically on the order of several
seconds to several minutes. The second mechanism, sometimes called a
<em>triggered</em> update, happens whenever a node notices a link failure or
receives an update from one of its neighbors that causes it to change
one of the routes in its routing table. Whenever a node’s routing table
changes, it sends an update to its neighbors, which may lead to a change
in their tables, causing them to send an update to their neighbors.</p>
<p>Now consider what happens when a link or node fails. The nodes that
notice first send new lists of distances to their neighbors, and
normally the system settles down fairly quickly to a new state. As to
the question of how a node detects a failure, there are a couple of
different answers. In one approach, a node continually tests the link to
another node by sending a control packet and seeing if it receives an
acknowledgment. In another approach, a node determines that the link (or
the node at the other end of the link) is down if it does not receive
the expected periodic routing update for the last few update cycles.</p>
<p>To understand what happens when a node detects a link failure, consider
what happens when F detects that its link to G has failed. First, F sets
its new distance to G to infinity and passes that information along
to&nbsp;A. Since A knows that its 2-hop path to G is through F, A would also
set its distance to G to infinity. However, with the next update from C,
A would learn that C has a 2-hop path to&nbsp;G. Thus, A would know that it
could reach G in 3 hops through C, which is less than infinity, and so A
would update its table accordingly. When it advertises this to F, node F
would learn that it can reach G at a cost of&nbsp;4 through A, which is less
than infinity, and the system would again become stable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, slightly different circumstances can prevent the network
from stabilizing. Suppose, for example, that the link from A to E goes
down. In the next round of updates, A advertises a distance of infinity
to E, but B and C advertise a distance of&nbsp;2 to&nbsp;E. Depending on the exact
timing of events, the following might happen: Node&nbsp;B, upon hearing that
E can be reached in 2&nbsp;hops from C, concludes that it can reach E in
3&nbsp;hops and&nbsp;advertises this to A; node&nbsp;A concludes that it can reach E in
4&nbsp;hops and advertises this to C; node&nbsp;C concludes that it can reach E in
5&nbsp;hops; and so on. This cycle stops only when the distances reach some
number that is large enough to be considered infinite. In the meantime,
none of the nodes actually knows that E is unreachable, and the routing
tables for the network do not stabilize. This situation is known as the
<em>count to infinity</em> problem.</p>
<p>There are several partial solutions to this problem. The first one is to
use some relatively small number as an approximation of infinity. For
example, we might decide that the maximum number of hops to get across a
certain network is never going to be more than 16, and so we could pick
16 as the value that represents infinity. This at least bounds the
amount of time that it takes to count to infinity. Of course, it could
also present a problem if our network grew to a point where some nodes
were separated by more than 16&nbsp;hops.</p>
<p>One technique to improve the time to stabilize routing is called <em>split
horizon</em>. The idea is that when a node sends a routing update to its
neighbors, it does not send those routes it learned from each neighbor
back to that neighbor. For example, if B has the route (E, 2, A) in its
table, then it knows it must have learned this route from A, and so
whenever B sends a routing update to A, it does not include the route
(E, 2) in that update. In a stronger variation of split horizon, called
<em>split horizon with poison reverse</em>, B actually sends that route back to
A, but it puts negative information in the route to ensure that A will
not eventually use B to get to E. For example, B sends the route (E, ∞)
to A. The problem with both of these techniques is that they only work
for routing loops that involve two nodes. For larger routing loops, more
drastic measures are called for. Continuing the above example, if B and
C had waited for a while after hearing of the link failure from A before
advertising routes to E, they would have found that neither of them
really had a route to E. Unfortunately, this approach delays the
convergence of the protocol; speed of convergence is one of the key
advantages of its competitor, link-state routing, the subject of a later
section.</p>

<h3>Routing Information Protocol (RIP)<a class="headerlink" href="#routing-information-protocol-rip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the more widely used routing protocols in IP networks is the
Routing Information Protocol (RIP). Its widespread use in the early days
of IP was due in no small part to the fact that it was distributed along
with the popular Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of Unix,
from which many commercial versions of Unix were derived. It is also
extremely simple. RIP is the canonical example of a routing protocol
built on the distance-vector algorithm just described.</p>
<p>Routing protocols in internetworks differ very slightly from the
idealized graph model described above. In an internetwork, the goal of
the routers is to learn how to forward packets to various <em>networks</em>.
Thus, rather than advertising the cost of reaching other routers, the
routers advertise the cost of reaching networks. For example, in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rip-eg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 86</span></a>, router&nbsp;C would advertise to router&nbsp;A
the fact that it can reach networks 2 and 3 (to which it is directly
connected) at a cost of 0, networks 5 and 6 at cost 1, and network&nbsp;4
at cost&nbsp;2.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id9">
<span id="fig-rip-eg"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-30-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-30-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-30-9780123850591.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 86. </span><span class="caption-text">Example network running RIP.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 87. </span><span class="caption-text">RIPv2 packet format.</span></p>
</div>
<p>We can see evidence of this in the RIP (version 2) packet format in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rip"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 87</span></a>. The majority of the packet is taken up
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(address,</span> <span class="pre">mask,</span> <span class="pre">distance)</span></code> triples. However, the principles of
the routing algorithm are just the same. For example, if router&nbsp;A
learns from router&nbsp;B that network&nbsp;X can be reached at a lower cost via
B than via the existing next hop in the routing table, A updates the
cost and next hop information for the network number accordingly.</p>
<p>RIP is in fact a fairly straightforward implementation of
distance-vector routing. Routers running RIP send their advertisements
every 30&nbsp;seconds; a router also sends an update message whenever an
update from another router causes it to change its routing table. One
point of interest is that it supports multiple address families, not
just IP—that is the reason for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Family</span></code> part of the
advertisements. RIP version&nbsp;2 (RIPv2) also introduced the subnet masks
described in an earlier section, whereas RIP version&nbsp;1 worked with the
old classful addresses of IP.</p>
<p>As we will see below, it is possible to use a range of different metrics
or costs for the links in a routing protocol. RIP takes the simplest
approach, with all link costs being equal to 1, just as in our example
above. Thus, it always tries to find the minimum hop route. Valid
distances are 1 through 15, with 16 representing infinity. This also
limits RIP to running on fairly small networks—those with no paths
longer than 15&nbsp;hops.</p>

<div class="section" id="link-state-ospf">
<h2>Link State (OSPF)<a class="headerlink" href="#link-state-ospf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Link-state routing is the second major class of intradomain routing
protocol. The starting assumptions for link-state routing are rather
similar to those for distance-vector routing. Each node is assumed to be
capable of finding out the state of the link to its neighbors (up or
down) and the cost of each link. Again, we want to provide each node
with enough information to enable it to find the least-cost path to any
destination. The basic idea behind link-state protocols is very simple:
Every node knows how to reach its directly connected neighbors, and if
we make sure that the totality of this knowledge is disseminated to
every node, then every node will have enough knowledge of the network to
build a complete map of the network. This is clearly a sufficient
condition (although not a necessary one) for finding the shortest path
to any point in the network. Thus, link-state routing protocols rely on
two mechanisms: reliable dissemination of link-state information, and
the calculation of routes from the sum of all the accumulated link-state
knowledge.</p>
<div class="section" id="reliable-flooding">
<h3>Reliable Flooding<a class="headerlink" href="#reliable-flooding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Reliable flooding</em> is the process of making sure that all the nodes
participating in the routing protocol get a copy of the link-state
information from all the other nodes. As the term <em>flooding</em> suggests,
the basic idea is for a node to send its link-state information out on
all of its directly connected links; each node that receives this
information then forwards it out on all of <em>its</em> links. This process
continues until the information has reached all the nodes in the
network.</p>
<p>More precisely, each node creates an update packet, also called a
<em>link-state packet</em> (LSP), which contains the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ID of the node that created the LSP</li>
<li>A list of directly connected neighbors of that node, with the cost of
the link to each one</li>
<li>A sequence number</li>
<li>A time to live for this packet</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two items are needed to enable route calculation; the last two
are used to make the process of flooding the packet to all nodes
reliable. Reliability includes making sure that you have the most recent
copy of the information, since there may be multiple, contradictory LSPs
from one node traversing the network. Making the flooding reliable has
proven to be quite difficult. (For example, an early version of
link-state routing used in the ARPANET caused that network to fail in
1981.)</p>
<p>Flooding works in the following way. First, the transmission of LSPs
between adjacent routers is made reliable using acknowledgments and
retransmissions just as in the reliable link-layer protocol. However,
several more steps are necessary to reliably flood an LSP to all nodes
in a network.</p>
<p>Consider a node&nbsp;X that receives a copy of an LSP that originated at some
other node&nbsp;Y. Note that Y may be any other router in the same routing
domain as X. X checks to see if it has already stored a copy of an LSP
from Y. If not, it stores the LSP. If it already has a copy, it compares
the sequence numbers; if the new LSP has a larger sequence number, it is
assumed to be the more recent, and that LSP is stored, replacing the old
one. A smaller (or equal) sequence number would imply an LSP older (or
not newer) than the one stored, so it would be discarded and no further
action would be needed. If the received LSP was the newer one, X then
sends a copy of that LSP to all of its neighbors except the neighbor
from which the LSP was just received. The fact that the LSP is not sent
back to the node from which it was received helps to bring an end to the
flooding of an LSP. Since X passes the LSP on to all its neighbors, who
then turn around and do the same thing, the most recent copy of the LSP
eventually reaches all nodes.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id11">
<span id="fig-flood"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-32-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-32-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-32-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 88. </span><span class="caption-text">Flooding of link-state packets: (a)&nbsp;LSP arrives at
node&nbsp;X; (b)&nbsp;X&nbsp;floods LSP to A and&nbsp;C; (c)&nbsp;A&nbsp;and C flood LSP to B

</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-flood"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 88</span></a> shows an LSP being flooded in a small
network.  Each node becomes shaded as it stores the new LSP. In
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-flood"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 88(a)</span></a> the LSP arrives at node X, which
sends it to neighbors A and C in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-flood"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 88(b)</span></a>. A
and C do not send it back to X, but send it on to B. Since B receives
two identical copies of the LSP, it will accept whichever arrived
first and ignore the second as a duplicate. It then passes the LSP
onto D, which has no neighbors to flood it to, and the process is
complete.</p>
<p>Just as in RIP, each node generates LSPs under two circumstances. Either
the expiry of a periodic timer or a change in topology can cause a node
to generate a new LSP. However, the only topology-based reason for a
node to generate an LSP is if one of its directly connected links or
immediate neighbors has gone down. The failure of a link can be detected
in some cases by the link-layer protocol. The demise of a neighbor or
loss of connectivity to that neighbor can be detected using periodic
“hello” packets. Each node sends these to its immediate neighbors at
defined intervals. If a sufficiently long time passes without receipt of
a “hello” from a neighbor, the link to that neighbor will be declared
down, and a new LSP will be generated to reflect this fact.</p>
<p>One of the important design goals of a link-state protocol’s flooding
mechanism is that the newest information must be flooded to all nodes as
quickly as possible, while old information must be removed from the
network and not allowed to circulate. In addition, it is clearly
desirable to minimize the total amount of routing traffic that is sent
around the network; after all, this is just overhead from the
perspective of those who actually use the network for their
applications. The next few paragraphs describe some of the ways that
these goals are accomplished.</p>
<p>One easy way to reduce overhead is to avoid generating LSPs unless
absolutely necessary. This can be done by using very long timers—often
on the order of hours—for the periodic generation of LSPs. Given that
the flooding protocol is truly reliable when topology changes, it is
safe to assume that messages saying “nothing has changed” do not need to
be sent very often.</p>
<p>To make sure that old information is replaced by newer information, LSPs
carry sequence numbers. Each time a node generates a new LSP, it
increments the sequence number by&nbsp;1. Unlike most sequence numbers used
in protocols, these sequence numbers are not expected to wrap, so the
field needs to be quite large (say, 64&nbsp;bits). If a node goes down and
then comes back up, it starts with a sequence number of 0. If the node
was down for a long time, all the old LSPs for that node will have timed
out (as described below); otherwise, this node will eventually receive a
copy of its own LSP with a higher sequence number, which it can then
increment and use as its own sequence number. This will ensure that its
new LSP replaces any of its old LSPs left over from before the node went
down.</p>
<p>LSPs also carry a time to live. This is used to ensure that old
link-state information is eventually removed from the network. A node
always decrements the TTL of a newly received LSP before flooding it to
its neighbors. It also “ages” the LSP while it is stored in the node.
When the TTL reaches&nbsp;0, the node refloods the LSP with a TTL of&nbsp;0, which
is interpreted by all the nodes in the network as a signal to delete
that LSP.</p>

<h3>Route Calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#route-calculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once a given node has a copy of the LSP from every other node, it is
able to compute a complete map for the topology of the network, and from
this map it is able to decide the best route to each destination. The
question, then, is exactly how it calculates routes from this
information. The solution is based on a well-known algorithm from graph
theory—Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm.</p>
<p>We first define Dijkstra’s algorithm in graph-theoretic terms. Imagine
that a node takes all the LSPs it has received and constructs a
graphical representation of the network, in which N denotes the set of
nodes in the graph, l(i,j) denotes the nonnegative cost (weight)
associated with the edge between nodes i, j in N and l(i, j) = ∞ if no
edge connects i and j. In the following description, we let s in N
denote this node, that is, the node executing the algorithm to find the
shortest path to all the other nodes in N. Also, the algorithm maintains
the following two variables: M denotes the set of nodes incorporated so
far by the algorithm, and C(n) denotes the cost of the path from s to
each node n. Given these definitions, the algorithm is defined as
follows:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Basically, the algorithm works as follows. We start with M containing
this node s and then initialize the table of costs (the array <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C(n)</span></code>)
to other nodes using the known costs to directly connected nodes. We
then look for the node that is reachable at the lowest cost (w) and add
it to M. Finally, we update the table of costs by considering the cost
of reaching nodes through w. In the last line of the algorithm, we
choose a new route to node n that goes through node w if the total cost
of going from the source to w and then following the link from w to n is
less than the old route we had to n. This procedure is repeated until
all nodes are incorporated in&nbsp;M.</p>
<p>In practice, each switch computes its routing table directly from the
LSPs it has collected using a realization of Dijkstra’s algorithm called
the <em>forward search</em> algorithm. Specifically, each switch maintains two
lists, known as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tentative</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Confirmed</span></code>. Each of these lists
contains a set of entries of the form <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Destination,</span> <span class="pre">Cost,</span> <span class="pre">NextHop)</span></code>.
The algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Initialize the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Confirmed</span></code> list with an entry for myself; this
entry has a cost of 0.</li>
<li>For the node just added to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Confirmed</span></code> list in the previous
step, call it node <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Next</span></code> and select its LSP.</li>
<li>For each neighbor (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code>) of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Next</span></code>, calculate the cost
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Cost</span></code>) to reach this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code> as the sum of the cost from
myself to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Next</span></code> and from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Next</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code>.<ol class="arabic">
<li>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code> is currently on neither the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Confirmed</span></code> nor the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tentative</span></code> list, then add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Neighbor,</span> <span class="pre">Cost,</span> <span class="pre">NextHop)</span></code> to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tentative</span></code> list, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHop</span></code> is the direction I go to

<li>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code> is currently on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tentative</span></code> list, and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Cost</span></code> is less than the currently listed cost for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Neighbor</span></code>,
then replace the current entry with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Neighbor,</span> <span class="pre">Cost,</span> <span class="pre">NextHop)</span></code>,
where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHop</span></code> is the direction I go to reach <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Next</span></code>.</li>

</li>
<li>If the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tentative</span></code> list is empty, stop. Otherwise, pick the entry

<p>The link-state routing algorithm has many nice properties: It has been
proven to stabilize quickly, it does not generate much traffic, and it
responds rapidly to topology changes or node failures. On the downside,
the amount of information stored at each node (one LSP for every other
node in the network) can be quite large. This is one of the fundamental
problems of routing and is an instance of the more general problem of
scalability. Some solutions to both the specific problem (the amount of
storage potentially required at each node) and the general problem
(scalability) will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">Distance-vector and link-state are both distributed routing
algorithms, but they adopt different strategies. In
distance-vector, each node talks only to its directly connected
neighbors, but it tells them everything it has learned (i.e.,
distance to all nodes). In link-state, each node talks to all other
nodes, but it tells them only what it knows for sure (i.e., only
the state of its directly connected links). In contrast to both of
these algorithms, we will consider a more centralized approach to
routing in <a class="reference internal" href="impl.html#implementation"><span class="std std-ref">Section 3.5</span></a> when we

<h3>The Open Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-open-shortest-path-first-protocol-ospf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the most widely used link-state routing protocols is OSPF. The
first word, “Open,” refers to the fact that it is an open,
nonproprietary standard, created under the auspices of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). The “SPF” part comes from an alternative
name for link-state routing. OSPF adds quite a number of features to the
basic link-state algorithm described above, including the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Authentication of routing messages</em>—One feature of distributed
routing algorithms is that they disperse information from one node to
many other nodes, and the entire network can thus be impacted by bad
information from one node. For this reason, it’s a good idea to be
sure that all the nodes taking part in the protocol can be trusted.
Authenticating routing messages helps achieve this. Early versions of
OSPF used a simple 8-byte password for authentication. This is not a
strong enough form of authentication to prevent dedicated malicious
users, but it alleviates some problems caused by misconfiguration or
casual attacks. (A similar form of authentication was added to RIP in
version&nbsp;2.) Strong cryptographic authentication was later added.</li>
<li><em>Additional hierarchy</em>—Hierarchy is one of the fundamental tools used
to make systems more scalable. OSPF introduces another layer of
hierarchy into routing by allowing a domain to be partitioned into
<em>areas</em>. This means that a router within a domain does not
necessarily need to know how to reach every network within that
domain—it may be able to get by knowing only how to get to the right
area. Thus, there is a reduction in the amount of information that
must be transmitted to and stored in each node.</li>
<li><em>Load balancing</em>—OSPF allows multiple routes to the same place to be
assigned the same cost and will cause traffic to be distributed
evenly over those routes, thus making better use of the available
network capacity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id14">
<span id="fig-ospf"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-34-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-34-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-34-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 90. </span><span class="caption-text">OSPF header format.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are several different types of OSPF messages, but all begin with
the same header, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ospf"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 90</span></a>. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Version</span></code> field is currently set to 2, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span></code> field may
take the values 1 through 5. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SourceAddr</span></code> identifies the sender
of the message, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AreaId</span></code> is a 32-bit identifier of the area
in which the node is located. The entire packet, except the
authentication data, is protected by a 16-bit checksum using the same
algorithm as the IP header. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Authentication</span> <span class="pre">type</span></code> is&nbsp;0 if no
authentication is used; otherwise, it may be 1, implying that a simple
password is used, or 2, which indicates that a cryptographic
authentication checksum is used. In the latter cases, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Authentication</span></code> field carries the password or cryptographic
checksum.</p>
<p>Of the five OSPF message types, type 1 is the “hello” message, which a
router sends to its peers to notify them that it is still alive and
connected as described above. The remaining types are used to request,
send, and acknowledge the receipt of link-state messages. The basic
building block of link-state messages in OSPF is the link-state
advertisement (LSA). One message may contain many LSAs. We provide a few
details of the LSA here.</p>
<p>Like any internetwork routing protocol, OSPF must provide information
about how to reach networks. Thus, OSPF must provide a little more
information than the simple graph-based protocol described above.
Specifically, a router running OSPF may generate link-state packets that
advertise one or more of the networks that are directly connected to
that router. In addition, a router that is connected to another router
by some link must advertise the cost of reaching that router over the
link. These two types of advertisements are necessary to enable all the
routers in a domain to determine the cost of reaching all networks in
that domain and the appropriate next hop for each network.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id15">
<span id="fig-ospf-lsa"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-35-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-35-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-35-9780123850591.png" style="width: 450px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 91. </span><span class="caption-text">OSPF link-state advertisement.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ospf-lsa"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 91</span></a> shows the packet format for a
type&nbsp;1 link-state advertisement. Type&nbsp;1 LSAs advertise the cost of
links between routers.  Type&nbsp;2 LSAs are used to advertise networks to
which the advertising router is connected, while other types are used
to support additional hierarchy as described in the next section. Many
fields in the LSA should be familiar from the preceding
discussion. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LS</span> <span class="pre">Age</span></code> is the equivalent of a time to live, except
that it counts up and the LSA expires when the age reaches a defined
maximum value. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span></code> field tells us that this is a type 1 LSA.</p>
<p>In a type 1 LSA, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Link</span> <span class="pre">state</span> <span class="pre">ID</span></code> and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Advertising</span> <span class="pre">router</span></code>
field are identical. Each carries a 32-bit identifier for the router
that created this LSA. While a number of assignment strategies may be
used to assign this ID, it is essential that it be unique in the routing
domain and that a given router consistently uses the same router ID. One
way to pick a router&nbsp;ID that meets these requirements would be to pick
the lowest IP address among all the IP addresses assigned to that
router. (Recall that a router may have a different IP address on each of
its interfaces.)</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LS</span> <span class="pre">sequence</span> <span class="pre">number</span></code> is used exactly as described above to detect
old or duplicate LSAs. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LS&nbsp;checksum</span></code> is similar to others we have
seen in other protocols; it is, of course, used to verify that data has
not been corrupted. It covers all fields in the packet except
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LS</span> <span class="pre">Age</span></code>, so it is not necessary to recompute a checksum every time
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LS</span> <span class="pre">Age</span></code> is incremented. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Length</span></code> is the length in bytes of the
complete LSA.</p>
<p>Now we get to the actual link-state information. This is made a little
complicated by the presence of TOS (type of service) information.
Ignoring that for a moment, each link in the LSA is represented by a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Link&nbsp;ID</span></code>, some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Link</span> <span class="pre">Data</span></code>, and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metric</span></code>. The first two of
these fields identify the link; a common way to do this would be to use
the router&nbsp;ID of the router at the far end of the link as the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Link&nbsp;ID</span></code> and then use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Link</span> <span class="pre">Data</span></code> to disambiguate among
multiple parallel links if necessary. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metric</span></code> is of course the
cost of the link. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span></code> tells us something about the link—for
example, if it is a point-to-point link.</p>
<p>The TOS information is present to allow OSPF to choose different routes
for IP packets based on the value in their TOS field. Instead of
assigning a single metric to a link, it is possible to assign different
metrics depending on the TOS value of the data. For example, if we had a
link in our network that was very good for delay-sensitive traffic, we
could give it a low metric for the TOS value representing low delay and
a high metric for everything else. OSPF would then pick a different
shortest path for those packets that had their TOS field set to that
value. It is worth noting that, at the time of writing, this capability
has not been widely deployed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metrics">
<h2>Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preceding discussion assumes that link costs, or metrics, are known
when we execute the routing algorithm. In this section, we look at some
ways to calculate link costs that have proven effective in practice. One
example that we have seen already, which is quite reasonable and very
simple, is to assign a cost of&nbsp;1 to all links—the least-cost route will
then be the one with the fewest hops. Such an approach has several
drawbacks, however. First, it does not distinguish between links on a
latency basis. Thus, a satellite link with 250-ms latency looks just as
attractive to the routing protocol as a terrestrial link with 1-ms
latency. Second, it does not distinguish between routes on a capacity
basis, making a 1-Mbps link look just as good as a 10-Gbps link.
Finally, it does not distinguish between links based on their current
load, making it impossible to route around overloaded links. It turns
out that this last problem is the hardest because you are trying to
capture the complex and dynamic characteristics of a link in a single
scalar cost.</p>
<p>The ARPANET was the testing ground for a number of different approaches
to link-cost calculation. (It was also the place where the superior
stability of link-state over distance-vector routing was demonstrated;
the original mechanism used distance vector while the later version used
link state.) The following discussion traces the evolution of the
ARPANET routing metric and, in so doing, explores the subtle aspects of
the problem.</p>
<p>The original ARPANET routing metric measured the number of packets that
were queued waiting to be transmitted on each link, meaning that a link
with 10 packets queued waiting to be transmitted was assigned a larger
cost weight than a link with 5 packets queued for transmission. Using
queue length as a routing metric did not work well, however, since queue
length is an artificial measure of load—it moves packets toward the
shortest queue rather than toward the destination, a situation all too
familiar to those of us who hop from line to line at the grocery store.
Stated more precisely, the original ARPANET routing mechanism suffered
from the fact that it did not take either the bandwidth or the latency
of the link into consideration.</p>
<p>A second version of the ARPANET routing algorithm took both link
bandwidth and latency into consideration and used delay, rather than
just queue length, as a measure of load. This was done as follows.
First, each incoming packet was timestamped with its time of arrival at
the router (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ArrivalTime</span></code>); its departure time from the router
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DepartTime</span></code>) was also recorded. Second, when the link-level ACK was
received from the other side, the node computed the delay for that
packet as</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Delay</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DepartTime</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">ArrivalTime</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TransmissionTime</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Latency</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TransmissionTime</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Latency</span></code> were statically defined for
the link and captured the link’s bandwidth and latency, respectively.
Notice that in this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DepartTime</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">ArrivalTime</span></code> represents the
amount of time the packet was delayed (queued) in the node due to load.
If the ACK did not arrive, but instead the packet timed out, then
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DepartTime</span></code> was reset to the time the packet was <em>retransmitted</em>. In
this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DepartTime</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">ArrivalTime</span></code> captures the reliability of the
link—the more frequent the retransmission of packets, the less reliable
the link, and the more we want to avoid it. Finally, the weight assigned
to each link was derived from the average delay experienced by the
packets recently sent over that link.</p>
<p>Although an improvement over the original mechanism, this approach also
had a lot of problems. Under light load, it worked reasonably well,
since the two static factors of delay dominated the cost. Under heavy
load, however, a congested link would start to advertise a very high
cost. This caused all the traffic to move off that link, leaving it
idle, so then it would advertise a low cost, thereby attracting back all
the traffic, and so on. The effect of this instability was that, under
heavy load, many links would in fact spend a great deal of time being
idle, which is the last thing you want under heavy load.</p>
<p>Another problem was that the range of link values was much too large.
For example, a heavily loaded 9.6-kbps link could look 127 times more
costly than a lightly loaded 56-kbps link. (Keep in mind, we’re talking
about the ARPANET circa 1975.) This means that the routing algorithm
would choose a path with 126&nbsp;hops of lightly loaded 56-kbps links in
preference to a 1-hop 9.6-kbps path. While shedding some traffic from an
overloaded line is a good idea, making it look so unattractive that it
loses all its traffic is excessive. Using 126 hops when 1 hop will do is
in general a bad use of network resources. Also, satellite links were
unduly penalized, so that an idle 56-kbps satellite link looked
considerably more costly than an idle 9.6-kbps terrestrial link, even
though the former would give better performance for high-bandwidth
applications.</p>
<p>A third approach addressed these problems. The major changes were to
compress the dynamic range of the metric considerably, to account for
the link type, and to smooth the variation of the metric with time.</p>
<p>The smoothing was achieved by several mechanisms. First, the delay
measurement was transformed to a link utilization, and this number was
averaged with the last reported utilization to suppress sudden changes.
Second, there was a hard limit on how much the metric could change from
one measurement cycle to the next. By smoothing the changes in the cost,
the likelihood that all nodes would abandon a route at once is greatly
reduced.</p>
<p>The compression of the dynamic range was achieved by feeding the
measured utilization, the link type, and the link speed into a
function that is shown graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-metric"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 92</span></a>. below. Observe the following:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id16">
<span id="fig-metric"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 92. </span><span class="caption-text">Revised ARPANET routing metric versus link
utilization.</span></p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A highly loaded link never shows a cost of more than three times its
cost when idle.</li>
<li>The most expensive link is only seven times the cost of the least
expensive.</li>
<li>A high-speed satellite link is more attractive than a low-speed
terrestrial link.</li>
<li>Cost is a function of link utilization only at moderate to high
loads.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these factors mean that a link is much less likely to be
universally abandoned, since a threefold increase in cost is likely to
make the link unattractive for some paths while letting it remain the
best choice for others. The slopes, offsets, and breakpoints for the
curves in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-metric"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 92</span></a> were arrived at by a great
deal of trial and error, and they were carefully tuned to provide good
performance.</p>
<p>Despite all these improvements, it turns out that in the majority of
real-world network deployments, metrics change rarely if at all and only
under the control of a network administrator, not automatically as
described above. The reason for this is partly that conventional wisdom
now holds that dynamically changing metrics are too unstable, even
though this probably need not be true. Perhaps more significantly, many
networks today lack the great disparity of link speeds and latencies
that prevailed in the ARPANET. Thus, static metrics are the norm. One
common approach to setting metrics is to use a constant multiplied by
(1/link_bandwidth).</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">Why do we still tell the story about a decades old algorithm that’s
no longer in use? Because it perfectly illustrates two valuable
lessons. The first is that computer systems are often <em>designed
iteratively based on experience.</em> We seldom get it right the first
time, so it’s important to deploy a simple solution sooner rather
than later, and expect to improve it over time. Staying stuck in the
design phase indefinitely is usually not a good plan. The second
is the well-know KISS principle: <em>Keep it Simple, Stupid.</em> When
building a complex system, less is often more. Opportunities to
invent sophisticated optimizations are plentiful, and it’s a tempting
opportunity to pursue. While such optimizations sometimes have
short-term value, it is shocking how often a simple approach proves
best over time. This is because when a system has many moving parts,
as the Internet most certainly does, keeping each part as simple as
possible is usually the best approach.  <a class="reference internal" href="impl.html#key-control-data"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>
