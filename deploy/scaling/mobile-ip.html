<h1>4.5 Routing Among Mobile Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#routing-among-mobile-devices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It probably should not be a great surprise to learn that mobile devices
present some challenges for the Internet architecture. The Internet was
designed in an era when computers were large, immobile devices, and,
while the Internet’s designers probably had some notion that mobile
devices might appear in the future, it’s fair to assume it was not a top
priority to accommodate them. Today, of course, mobile computers are
everywhere, notably in the form of laptops and smartphones, and
increasingly in other forms, such as drones. In this section, we will
look at some of the challenges posed by the appearance of mobile devices
and some of the current approaches to accommodating them.</p>
<div class="section" id="challenges-for-mobile-networking">
<h2>Challenges for Mobile Networking<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-for-mobile-networking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is easy enough today to turn up in a wireless hotspot, connect to the
Internet using 802.11 or some other wireless networking protocol, and
obtain pretty good Internet service. One key enabling technology that
made the hotspot feasible is DHCP. You can settle in at a coffee shop,
open your laptop, obtain an IP address for your laptop, and get your
laptop talking to a default router and a Domain Name System (DNS)
server, and for a broad class of applications you have everything you
need.</p>
<p>If we look a little more closely, however, it’s clear that for some
application scenarios, just getting a new IP address every time you
move—which is what DHCP does for you—isn’t always enough. Suppose you
are using your laptop or smartphone for a Voice over IP telephone
call, and while talking on the phone you move from one hotspot to
another, or even switch from Wi-Fi to the cellular network for your
Internet connection.</p>
<p>Clearly, when you move from one access network to another, you need to
get a new IP address—one that corresponds to the new network. But, the
computer or telephone at the other end of your conversation doesn’t
immediately know where you have moved or what your new IP address is.
Consequently, in the absence of some other mechanism, packets would
continue to be sent to the address where you <em>used</em> to be, not where
you are now. This problem is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mobileeg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 122</span></a>; as the mobile node moves from the 802.11 network in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mobileeg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 122(a)</span></a> to the cellular network in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mobileeg"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 122(b)</span></a>, somehow packets from the
<em>correspondent node</em> need to find their way to the new network and
then on to the mobile node.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-mobileeg"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-26-22092018.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-26-22092018.png" src="../_images/f04-26-22092018.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 122. </span><span class="caption-text">Forwarding packets from a correspondent node to a
mobile node.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are many different ways to tackle the problem just described, and
we will look at some of them below. Assuming that there is some way to
redirect packets so that they come to your new address rather than your
old address, the next immediately apparent problems relate to security.
For example, if there is a mechanism by which I can say, “My new IP
address is X,” how do I prevent some attacker from making such a
statement without my permission, thus enabling him to either receive my
packets, or to redirect my packets to some unwitting third party? Thus,
we see that security and mobility are quite closely related.</p>
<p>One issue that the above discussion highlights is the fact that IP
addresses actually serve two tasks. They are used as an <em>identifier</em> of
an endpoint, and they are also used to <em>locate</em> the endpoint. Think of
the identifier as a long-lived name for the endpoint, and the locator as
some possibly more temporary information about how to route packets to
the endpoint. As long as devices do not move, or do not move often,
using a single address for both jobs seem pretty reasonable. But once
devices start to move, you would rather like to have an identifier that
does not change as you move—this is sometimes called an <em>Endpoint
Identifier</em> or <em>Host Identifier</em>—and a separate <em>locator</em>. This idea of
separating locators from identifiers has been around for a long time,
and most of the approaches to handling mobility described below provide
such a separation in some form.</p>
<p>The assumption that IP addresses don’t change shows up in many different
places. For example, transport protocols like TCP have historically made
assumptions about the IP address staying constant for the life of a
connection, so one approach could be to redesign transport protocols so
they can operate with changing end-point addresses.</p>
<p>But rather than try to change TCP, a common alternative is for the
application to periodically re-establish the TCP connection in case the
client’s IP address has changed. As strange as this sounds, if the
application is HTTP-based (e.g., a web browser like Chrome or a
streaming application like Netflix) then that is exactly what happens.
In other words, the strategy is for the application to work around
situations where the user’s IP address may have changed, instead of
trying to maintain the appearance that it does not change.</p>
<p>While we are all familiar with endpoints that move, it is worth noting
that routers can also move. This is certainly less common today than
endpoint mobility, but there are plenty of environments where a mobile
router might make sense. One example might be an emergency response
team trying to deploy a network after some natural disaster has
knocked out all the fixed infrastructure. There are additional
considerations when <em>all</em> the nodes in a network, not just the
endpoints, are mobile, a topic we will discuss later in this section.</p>
<p>Before we start to look at some of the approaches to supporting mobile
devices, a couple of points of clarification. It is common to find that
people confuse wireless networks with mobility. After all, mobility and
wireless often are found together for obvious reasons. But wireless
communication is really about getting data from A to B without a wire,
while mobility is about dealing with what happens when a node moves
around as it communicates. Certainly many nodes that use wireless
communication channels are not mobile, and sometimes mobile nodes will
use wired communication (although this is less common).</p>
<p>Finally, in this chapter we are mostly interested in what we might
call <em>network-layer mobility</em>. That is, we are interested in how to
deal with nodes that move from one network to another. Moving from one
access point to another in the same 802.11 network can be handled by
mechanisms specific to 802.11, and cellular networks also have ways to
handle mobility, of course, but in large heterogeneous systems like
the Internet we need to support mobility more broadly across networks.</p>

<div class="section" id="routing-to-mobile-hosts-mobile-ip">
<h2>Routing to Mobile Hosts (Mobile IP)<a class="headerlink" href="#routing-to-mobile-hosts-mobile-ip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Mobile IP is the primary mechanism in today’s Internet architecture to
tackle the problem of routing packets to mobile hosts. It introduces a
few new capabilities but does not require any change from non-mobile
hosts or most routers—thus making it incrementally deployable.</p>
<p>The mobile host is assumed to have a permanent IP address, called its
<em>home address</em>, which has a network prefix equal to that of its <em>home
network</em>. This is the address that will be used by other hosts when they
initially send packets to the mobile host; because it does not change,
it can be used by long-lived applications as the host roams. We can
think of this as the long-lived identifier of the host.</p>
<p>When the host moves to a new foreign network away from its home network,
it typically acquires a new address on that network using some means
such as DHCP. This address is going to change every time the host roams
to a new network, so we can think of this as being more like the locator
for the host, but it is important to note that the host does not lose
its permanent home address when it acquires a new address on the foreign
network. This home address is critical to its ability to sustain
communications as it moves, as we’ll see below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Because DHCP was developed around the same time as Mobile IP, the
original Mobile IP standards did not require DHCP, but DHCP is
ubiquitous today.</div></blockquote>
<p>While the majority of routers remain unchanged, mobility support does
require some new functionality in at least one router, known as the
<em>home agent</em> of the mobile node. This router is located on the home
network of the mobile host. In some cases, a second router with enhanced
functionality, the <em>foreign agent,</em> is also required. This router is
located on a network to which the mobile node attaches itself when it is
away from its home network. We will consider first the operation of
Mobile&nbsp;IP when a foreign agent is used. An example network with both
home and foreign agents is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mobile"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 123</span></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-mobile"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-27-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-27-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-27-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 123. </span><span class="caption-text">Mobile host and mobility agents.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Both home and foreign agents periodically announce their presence on the
networks to which they are attached using agent advertisement messages.
A mobile host may also solicit an advertisement when it attaches to a
new network. The advertisement by the home agent enables a mobile host
to learn the address of its home agent before it leaves its home
network. When the mobile host attaches to a foreign network, it hears an
advertisement from a foreign agent and registers with the agent,
providing the address of its home agent. The foreign agent then contacts
the home agent, providing a <em>care-of address</em>. This is usually the IP
address of the foreign agent.</p>
<p>At this point, we can see that any host that tries to send a packet to
the mobile host will send it with a destination address equal to the
home address of that node. Normal IP forwarding will cause that packet
to arrive on the home network of the mobile node on which the home agent
is sitting. Thus, we can divide the problem of delivering the packet to
the mobile node into three parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>How does the home agent intercept a packet that is destined for the
mobile node?</li>
<li>How does the home agent then deliver the packet to the foreign agent?</li>
<li>How does the foreign agent deliver the packet to the mobile node?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem might look easy if you just look at <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mobile"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
123</span></a>, in which the home agent is clearly the only path between
the sending host and the home network and thus must receive packets that
are destined to the mobile node. But what if the sending (correspondent)
node were on network&nbsp;18, or what if there were another router connected
to network&nbsp;18 that tried to deliver the packet without its passing
through the home agent? To address this problem, the home agent actually
impersonates the mobile node, using a technique called <em>proxy ARP.</em> This
works just like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), except that the home
agent inserts the IP address of the mobile node, rather than its own, in
the ARP messages. It uses its own hardware address, so that all the
nodes on the same network learn to associate the hardware address of the
home agent with the IP address of the mobile node. One subtle aspect of
this process is the fact that ARP information may be cached in other
nodes on the network. To make sure that these caches are invalidated in
a timely way, the home agent issues an ARP message as soon as the mobile
node registers with a foreign agent. Because the ARP message is not a
response to a normal ARP request, it is termed a <em>gratuitous ARP</em>.</p>
<p>The second problem is the delivery of the intercepted packet to the
foreign agent. Here we use the tunneling technique described elsewhere.
The home agent simply wraps the packet inside an IP header that is
destined for the foreign agent and transmits it into the internetwork.
All the intervening routers just see an IP packet destined for the IP
address of the foreign agent. Another way of looking at this is that an
IP tunnel is established between the home agent and the foreign agent,
and the home agent just drops packets destined for the mobile node into
that tunnel.</p>
<p>When a packet finally arrives at the foreign agent, it strips the extra
IP header and finds inside an IP packet destined for the home address of
the mobile node. Clearly the foreign agent cannot treat this like any
old IP packet because this would cause it to send it back to the home
network. Instead, it has to recognize the address as that of a
registered mobile node. It then delivers the packet to the <em>hardware</em>
address of the mobile node (e.g., its Ethernet address), which was
learned as part of the registration process.</p>
<p>One observation that can be made about these procedures is that it is
possible for the foreign agent and the mobile node to be in the same
box; that is, a mobile node can perform the foreign agent function
itself. To make this work, however, the mobile node must be able to
dynamically acquire an IP address that is located in the address space
of the foreign network (e.g., using DHCP). This address will then be
used as the care-of address. In our example, this address would have a
network number of&nbsp;12. This approach has the desirable feature of
allowing mobile nodes to attach to networks that don’t have foreign
agents; thus, mobility can be achieved with only the addition of a
home agent and some new software on the mobile node (assuming DHCP is
used on the foreign network).</p>
<p>What about traffic in the other direction (i.e., from mobile node to
fixed node)? This turns out to be much easier. The mobile node just puts
the IP address of the fixed node in the destination field of its IP
packets while putting its permanent address in the source field, and the
packets are forwarded to the fixed node using normal means. Of course,
if both nodes in a conversation are mobile, then the procedures
described above are used in each direction.</p>
<div class="section" id="route-optimization-in-mobile-ip">
<h3>Route Optimization in Mobile IP<a class="headerlink" href="#route-optimization-in-mobile-ip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is one significant drawback to the above approach: The route from
the correspondent node to the mobile node can be significantly
suboptimal. One of the most extreme examples is when a mobile node and
the correspondent node are on the same network, but the home network for
the mobile node is on the far side of the Internet. The sending
correspondent node addresses all packets to the home network; they
traverse the Internet to reach the home agent, which then tunnels them
back across the Internet to reach the foreign agent. Clearly, it would
be nice if the correspondent node could find out that the mobile node is
actually on the same network and deliver the packet directly. In the
more general case, the goal is to deliver packets as directly as
possible from correspondent node to mobile node without passing through
a home agent. This is sometimes referred to as the <em>triangle routing
problem</em> since the path from correspondent to mobile node via home agent
takes two sides of a triangle, rather than the third side that is the
direct path.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind the solution to triangle routing is to let the
correspondent node know the care-of address of the mobile node. The
correspondent node can then create its own tunnel to the foreign agent.
This is treated as an optimization of the process just described. If the
sender has been equipped with the necessary software to learn the
care-of address and create its own tunnel, then the route can be
optimized; if not, packets just follow the suboptimal route.</p>
<p>When a home agent sees a packet destined for one of the mobile nodes
that it supports, it can deduce that the sender is not using the optimal
route. Therefore, it sends a “binding update” message back to the
source, in addition to forwarding the data packet to the foreign agent.
The source, if capable, uses this binding update to create an entry in a
<em>binding cache,</em> which consists of a list of mappings from mobile node
addresses to care-of addresses. The next time this source has a data
packet to send to that mobile node, it will find the binding in the
cache and can tunnel the packet directly to the foreign agent.</p>
<p>There is an obvious problem with this scheme, which is that the binding
cache may become out-of-date if the mobile host moves to a new network.
If an out-of-date cache entry is used, the foreign agent will receive
tunneled packets for a mobile node that is no longer registered on its
network. In this case, it sends a <em>binding warning</em> message back to the
sender to tell it to stop using this cache entry. This scheme works only
in the case where the foreign agent is not the mobile node itself,
however. For this reason, cache entries need to be deleted after some
period of time; the exact amount is specified in the binding update
message.</p>
<p>As noted above, mobile routing provides some interesting security
challenges, which are clearer now that we have seen how Mobile IP works.
For example, an attacker wishing to intercept the packets destined to
some other node in an internetwork could contact the home agent for that
node and announce itself as the new foreign agent for the node. Thus, it
is clear that some authentication mechanisms are required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mobility-in-ipv6">
<h3>Mobility in IPv6<a class="headerlink" href="#mobility-in-ipv6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a handful of significant differences between mobility support
in IPv4 and IPv6. Most importantly, it was possible to build mobility
support into the standards for IPv6 pretty much from the beginning, thus
alleviating a number of incremental deployment problems. (It may be more
correct to say that IPv6 is one big incremental deployment problem,
which, once solved, will deliver mobility support as part of the
package.)</p>
<p>Since all IPv6-capable hosts can acquire an address whenever they are
attached to a foreign network (using several mechanisms defined as part
of the core v6 specifications), Mobile IPv6 does away with the foreign
agent and includes the necessary capabilities to act as a foreign agent
in every host.</p>
<p>One other interesting aspect of IPv6 that comes into play with Mobile IP
is its inclusion of a flexible set of extension headers, as described
elsewhere in this chapter. This is used in the optimized routing
scenario described above. Rather than <em>tunneling</em> a packet to the mobile
node at its care-of address, an IPv6 node can send an IP packet to the
care-of address with the home address contained in a <em>routing header</em>.
This header is ignored by all the intermediate nodes, but it enables the
mobile node to treat the packet as if it were sent to the home address,
thus enabling it to continue presenting higher layer protocols with the
illusion that its IP address is fixed. Using an extension header rather
than a tunnel is more efficient from the perspective of both bandwidth
consumption and processing.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that many open issues remain in mobile networking.
Managing the power consumption of mobile devices is increasingly
important, so that smaller devices with limited battery power can be
built. There is also the problem of <em>ad hoc</em> mobile networks—enabling a
group of mobile nodes to form a network in the absence of any fixed
nodes—which has some special challenges. A particularly challenging
class of mobile networks is <em>sensor networks</em>. Sensors typically are
small, inexpensive, and often battery powered, meaning that issues of
very low power consumption and limited processing capability must also
be considered. Furthermore, since wireless communications and mobility
