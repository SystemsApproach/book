<h1>8.3 Key Predistribution<a class="headerlink" href="#key-predistribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To use ciphers and authenticators, the communicating participants need
to know what keys to use. In the case of a secret-key cipher, how does a
pair of participants obtain the key they share? In the case of a
public-key cipher, how do participants know what public key belongs to a
certain participant? The answer differs depending on whether the keys
are short-lived <em>session keys</em> or longer-lived <em>predistributed keys</em>.</p>
<p>A session key is a key used to secure a single, relatively short episode
of communication: a session. Each distinct session between a pair of
participants uses a new session key, which is always a secret key for
speed. The participants determine what session key to use by means of a
protocol—a session key establishment protocol. A session key
establishment protocol needs its own security (so that, for example, an
adversary cannot learn the new session key); that security is based on
the longer-lived predistributed keys.</p>
<p>There are two primary motivations for this division of labor between
session keys and predistributed keys:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Limiting the amount of time a key is used results in less time for
computationally intensive attacks, less ciphertext for cryptanalysis,
and less information exposed should the key be broken.</li>
<li>Public key ciphers are generally superior for authentication and
session key establishment but too slow to use for encrypting entire
messages for confidentiality.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section explains how predistributed keys are distributed, and the
next section will explain how session keys are then established. We
henceforth use “Alice” and “Bob” to designate participants, as is common
in the cryptography literature. Bear in mind that although we tend to
refer to participants in anthropomorphic terms, we are more frequently
concerned with the communication between software or hardware entities
such as clients and servers that often have no direct relationship with
any particular person.</p>
<div class="section" id="predistribution-of-public-keys">
<h2>Predistribution of Public Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#predistribution-of-public-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The algorithms to generate a matched pair of public and private keys are
publicly known, and software that does it is widely available. So, if
Alice wanted to use a public-key cipher, she could generate her own pair
of public and private keys, keep the private key hidden, and publicize
the public key. But, how can she publicize her public key—assert that it
belongs to her—in such a way that other participants can be sure it
really belongs to her? Not via email or Web, because an adversary could
forge an equally plausible claim that key <em>x</em> belongs to Alice when <em>x</em>
really belongs to the adversary.</p>
<p>A complete scheme for certifying bindings between public keys and
identities—what key belongs to whom—is called a <em>Public Key
Infrastructure</em> (PKI). A PKI starts with the ability to verify
identities and bind them to keys out of band. By “out of band,” we mean
something outside the network and the computers that comprise it, such
as in the following If Alice and Bob are individuals who know each
other, then they could get together in the same room and Alice could
give her public key to Bob directly, perhaps on a business card. If Bob
is an organization, Alice the individual could present conventional
identification, perhaps involving a photograph or fingerprints. If Alice
and Bob are computers owned by the same company, then a system
administrator could configure Bob with Alice’s public key.</p>
<p>Establishing keys out of band doesn’t sound like it would scale well,
but it suffices to bootstrap a PKI. Bob’s knowledge that Alice’s key is
<em>x</em> can be widely, scalably disseminated using a combination of digital
signatures and a concept of trust. For example, suppose that you have
received Bob’s public key out of band and that you know enough about Bob
to trust him on matters of keys and identities. Then Bob could send you
a message asserting that Alice’s key is <em>x</em> and—since you already know
Bob’s public key—you could authenticate the message as having come from
Bob. (Remember that to digitally sign the statement Bob would append a
cryptographic hash of it that has been encrypted using his private key.)
Since you trust Bob to tell the truth, you would now know that Alice’s
key is <em>x</em>, even though you had never met her or exchanged a single
message with her. Using digital signatures, Bob wouldn’t even have to
send you a message; he could simply create and publish a digitally
signed statement that Alice’s key is <em>x</em>. Such a digitally signed
statement of a public key binding is called a <em>public key certificate</em>,
or simply a certificate. Bob could send Alice a copy of the certificate,
or post it on a website. If and when someone needs to verify Alice’s
public key, they could do so by getting a copy of the certificate,
perhaps directly from Alice—as long as they trust Bob and know his
public key. You can see how starting from a very small number of keys
(in this case, just Bob’s) you could build up a large set of trusted
keys over time. Bob in this case is playing the role often referred to
as a <em>certification authority</em> (CA), and much of today’s Internet
security depends on CAs. VeriSign is one well-known commercial CA. We
return to this topic below.</p>
<p>One of the major standards for certificates is known as X.509. This
standard leaves a lot of details open, but specifies a basic structure.
A certificate clearly must include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The identity of the entity being certified</li>
<li>The public key of the entity being certified</li>
<li>The identity of the signer</li>
<li>The digital signature</li>
<li>A digital signature algorithm identifier (which cryptographic hash
and which cipher)</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional component is an expiration time for the certificate. We will
see a particular use of this feature below.</p>
<p>Since a certificate creates a binding between an identity and a public
key, we should look more closely at what we mean by “identity.” For
example, a certificate that says, “This public key belongs to John
Smith,” may not be terribly useful if you can’t tell which of the
thousands of John Smiths is being identified. Thus, certificates must
use a well-defined name space for the identities being certified; for
example, certificates are often issued for email addresses and DNS
domains.</p>
<p>There are different ways a PKI could formalize the notion of trust. We
discuss the two main approaches.</p>
<div class="section" id="certification-authorities">
<h3>Certification Authorities<a class="headerlink" href="#certification-authorities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this model of trust, trust is binary; you either trust someone
completely or not at all. Together with certificates, this allows the
building of <em>chains of trust</em>. If X certifies that a certain public key
belongs to&nbsp;Y, and then Y goes on to certify that another public key
belongs to&nbsp;Z, then there exists a chain of certificates from X to&nbsp;Z,
even though X and Z may have never met. If you know X’s key—and you
trust X and Y—then you can believe the certificate that gives Z’s key.
In other words, all you need is a chain of certificates, all signed by
entities you trust, as long as it leads back to an entity whose key you
already know.</p>
<p>A <em>certification authority</em> or <em>certificate authority</em> (CA) is an entity
claimed (by someone) to be trustworthy for verifying identities and
issuing public key certificates. There are commercial CAs, governmental
CAs, and even free CAs. To use a CA, you must know its own key. You can
learn that CA’s key, however, if you can obtain a chain of CA-signed
certificates that starts with a CA whose key you already know. Then you
can believe any certificate signed by that new CA.</p>
<p>A common way to build such chains is to arrange them in a
tree-structured hierarchy, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pem-tree"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 200</span></a>. If everyone has the public key of the root CA, then
any participant can provide a chain of certificates to another
participant and know that it will be sufficient to build a chain of
trust for that participant.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-pem-tree"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f08-06-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f08-06-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f08-06-9780123850591.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 200. </span><span class="caption-text">Tree-structured certification authority hierarchy.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are some significant issues with building chains of trust. Most
importantly, even if you are certain that you have the public key of the
root CA, you need to be sure that every CA from the root on down is
doing its job properly. If just one CA in the chain is willing to issue
certificates to entities without verifying their identities, then what
looks like a valid chain of certificates becomes meaningless. For
example, a root CA might issue a certificate to a second-tier CA and
thoroughly verify that the name on the certificate matches the business
name of the CA, but that second-tier CA might be willing to sell
certificates to anyone who asks, without verifying their identity. This
problem gets worse the longer the chain of trust. X.509 certificates
provide the option of restricting the set of entities that the subject
of a certificate is, in turn, trusted to certify.</p>
<p>There can be more than one root to a certification tree, and this is
common in securing Web transactions today, for example. Web browsers
such as Firefox and Internet Explorer come pre-equipped with
certificates for a set of CAs; in effect, the browser’s producer has
decided these CAs and their keys can be trusted. A user can also add CAs
to those that their browser recognizes as trusted. These certificates
are accepted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security
(TLS), the protocol most often used to secure Web transactions, which we
discuss in a later section. (If you are curious, you can poke around in
the preferences settings for your browser and find the “view
certificates” option to see how many CAs your browser is configured to
trust.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-of-trust">
<h3>Web of Trust<a class="headerlink" href="#web-of-trust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An alternative model of trust is the <em>web of trust</em> exemplified by
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which is further discussed in a later
section. PGP is a security system for email, so email addresses are the
identities to which keys are bound and by which certificates are signed.
In keeping with PGP’s roots as protection against government intrusion,
there are no CAs. Instead, every individual decides whom they trust and
how much they trust them—in this model, trust is a matter of degree. In
addition, a public key certificate can include a confidence level
indicating how confident the signer is of the key binding claimed in the
certificate, so a given user may have to have several certificates
attesting to the same key binding before he is willing to trust it.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a certificate for Bob provided by Alice;
you can assign a moderate level of trust to that certificate. However,
if you have additional certificates for Bob that were provided by C and
D, each of whom is also moderately trustworthy, that might considerably
increase your level of confidence that the public key you have for Bob
is valid. In short, PGP recognizes that the problem of establishing
trust is quite a personal matter and gives users the raw material to
make their own decisions, rather than assuming that they are all willing
to trust in a single hierarchical structure of CAs. To quote Phil
Zimmerman, the developer of PGP, “PGP is for people who prefer to pack
their own parachutes.”</p>
<p>PGP has become quite popular in the networking community, and PGP
key-signing parties are a regular feature of various networking events,
such as IETF meetings. At these gatherings, an individual can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Collect public keys from others whose identity he knows.</li>
<li>Provide his public key to others.</li>
<li>Get his public key signed by others, thus collecting certificates
that will be persuasive to an increasingly large set of people.</li>
<li>Sign the public key of other individuals, thus helping them build up
their set of certificates that they can use to distribute their
public keys.</li>
<li>Collect certificates from other individuals whom he trusts enough to
sign keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, over time, a user will collect a set of certificates with varying
degrees of trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="certificate-revocation">
<h3>Certificate Revocation<a class="headerlink" href="#certificate-revocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One issue that arises with certificates is how to revoke, or undo, a
certificate. Why is this important? Suppose that you suspect that
someone has discovered your private key. There may be any number of
certificates in the universe that assert that you are the owner of the
public key corresponding to that private key. The person who discovered
your private key thus has everything he needs to impersonate you: valid
certificates and your private key. To solve this problem, it would be
nice to be able to revoke the certificates that bind your old,
compromised key to your identity, so that the impersonator will no
longer be able to persuade other people that he is you.</p>
<p>The basic solution to the problem is simple enough. Each CA can issue a
<em>certificate revocation list</em> (CRL), which is a digitally signed list of
certificates that have been revoked. The CRL is periodically updated and
made publicly available. Because it is digitally signed, it can just be
posted on a website. Now, when Alice receives a certificate for Bob that
she wants to verify, she will first consult the latest CRL issued by the
CA. As long as the certificate has not been revoked, it is valid. Note
that, if all certificates have unlimited life spans, the CRL would
always be getting longer, since you could never take a certificate off
the CRL for fear that some copy of the revoked certificate might be
used. For this reason, it is common to attach an expiration date to a
certificate when it is issued. Thus, we can limit the length of time
that a revoked certificate needs to stay on a CRL. As soon as its
original expiration date is passed, it can be removed from the&nbsp;CRL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="predistribution-of-secret-keys">
<h2>Predistribution of Secret Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#predistribution-of-secret-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If Alice wants to use a secret-key cipher to communicate with Bob, she
can’t just pick a key and send it to him because, without already having
a key, they can’t encrypt this key to keep it confidential and they
can’t authenticate each other. As with public keys, some predistribution
scheme is needed. Predistribution is harder for secret keys than for
public keys for two obvious reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>While only one public key per entity is sufficient for authentication
and confidentiality, there must be a secret key for each pair of
entities who wish to communicate. If there are N entities, that means
N(N-1)/2 keys.</li>
<li>Unlike public keys, secret keys must be kept secret.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, there are a lot more keys to distribute, and you can’t use
certificates that everyone can read.</p>
<p>The most common solution is to use a <em>Key Distribution Center</em> (KDC). A
KDC is a trusted entity that shares a secret key with each other entity.
This brings the number of keys down to a more manageable N-1, few enough
to establish out of band for some applications. When Alice wishes to
communicate with Bob, that communication does not travel via the KDC.
Rather, the KDC participates in a protocol that authenticates Alice and
Bob—using the keys that the KDC already shares with each of them—and
generates a new session key for them to use. Then Alice and Bob
communicate directly using their session key. Kerberos is a widely used
system based on this approach. We describe Kerberos (which also provides
authentication) in the next section. The following subsection describes
a powerful alternative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diffie-hellman-key-exchange">
<h2>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#diffie-hellman-key-exchange" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another approach to establishing a shared secret key is to use the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, which works without using any
predistributed keys. The messages exchanged between Alice and Bob can be
read by anyone able to eavesdrop, and yet the eavesdropper won’t know
the secret key that Alice and Bob end up with.</p>
<p>Diffie-Hellman doesn’t authenticate the participants. Since it is rarely
useful to communicate securely without being sure whom you’re
communicating with, Diffie-Hellman is usually augmented in some way to
provide authentication. One of the main uses of Diffie-Hellman is in the
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, a central part of the IP Security
(IPsec) architecture.</p>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman protocol has two parameters, <em>p</em> and <em>g</em>, both of
which are public and may be used by all the users in a particular
system. Parameter <em>p</em> must be a prime number. The integers
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bmod p\)</span> (short for modulo <em>p</em>) are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> through <em>p-1</em>,
since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \bmod p\)</span> is the remainder after <em>x</em> is divided by <em>p</em>,
and form what mathematicians call a <em>group</em> under
multiplication. Parameter <em>g</em> (usually called a generator) must be a
<em>primitive root</em> of <em>p</em>: For every number <em>n</em> from 1 through <em>p-1</em>
there must be some value <em>k</em> such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = g^k \bmod p\)</span>. For
example, if <em>p</em> were the prime number 5 (a real system would use a
much larger number), then we might choose 2 to be the generator <em>g</em>
since:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[1 = 2^0 \bmod p\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[2 = 2^1 \bmod p\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[3 = 2^3 \bmod p\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[4 = 2^2 \bmod p\]</div>
<p>Suppose Alice and Bob want to agree on a shared secret key. Alice and
Bob, and everyone else, already know the values of <em>p</em> and <em>g</em>. Alice
generates a random private value <em>a</em> and Bob generates a random
private value&nbsp;<em>b</em>. Both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are drawn from the set of
integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{1,\dots{}, p-1\}\)</span>. Alice and Bob derive their
corresponding public values—the values they will send to each other
unencrypted—as follows. Alice’s public value is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^a \bmod p\]</div>
<p>and Bob’s public value is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^b \bmod p\]</div>
<p>They then exchange their public values. Finally, Alice computes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^{ab} \bmod p = (g^b \bmod p)^a \bmod p\]</div>
<p>and Bob computes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^{ba} \bmod p = (g^a \bmod p)^b \bmod p.\]</div>
<p>Alice and Bob now have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g^{ab} \bmod p\)</span> (which is equal to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g^{ba} \bmod p)\)</span> as their shared secret key.</p>
<p>Any eavesdropper would know <em>p, g</em>, and the two public values
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g^a \bmod p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g^b \bmod p\)</span>.
If only the eavesdropper could determine <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, she could easily
compute the resulting key. Determining <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> from that information
is, however, computationally infeasible for suitably large <em>p,a,</em> and
<em>b</em>; it is known as the <em>discrete logarithm problem</em>.</p>
<p>For example, using <em>p = 5</em> and <em>g = 2</em> from above, suppose Alice picks
the random number <em>a = 3</em> and Bob picks the random number <em>b = 4</em>.
Then Alice sends Bob the public value</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[2^3 \bmod 5 = 3\]</div>
<p>and Bob sends Alice the public value</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[2^4 \bmod 5 = 1\]</div>
<p>Alice is then able to compute</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^{ab} \bmod p = (2^b \bmod 5)^3 \bmod 5 = (1)^3 \bmod 5 = 1\]</div>
<p>by substituting Bob’s public value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((2^b \bmod 5)\)</span>. Similarly,
Bob is able to compute</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[g^{ba} \bmod p = (g^a \bmod 5)^4 \bmod 5 = (3)^4 \bmod 5 = 1.\]</div>
<p>by substituting Alice’s public value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((2^a \bmod 5)\)</span>.
Both Alice and Bob now agree that the secret key is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is the problem of Diffie-Hellman’s lack of authentication. One
attack that can take advantage of this is the <em>man-in-the-middle
attack</em>. Suppose Mallory is an adversary with the ability to intercept
messages. Mallory already knows <em>p</em> and <em>g</em> since they are public, and
she generates random private values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> to use
with Alice and Bob, respectively. When Alice and Bob send their public
values to each other, Mallory intercepts them and sends her own public
values, as in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-maninthemiddle"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 201</span></a>. The result is
that Alice and Bob each end up unknowingly sharing a key with Mallory
instead of each other.</p>

<p>A variant of Diffie-Hellman sometimes called <em>fixed Diffie-Hellman</em>
supports authentication of one or both participants. It relies on
certificates that are similar to public key certificates but instead
certify the Diffie-Hellman public parameters of an entity. For example,
such a certificate would state that Alice’s Diffie-Hellman parameters
are <em>p, g</em>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g^a \bmod p\)</span>
(note that the value of <em>a</em> would still be known only to Alice). Such
a certificate would assure Bob that the other participant in
Diffie-Hellman is Alice—or else the other participant won’t be able to
compute the secret key, because she won’t know <em>a</em>. If both participants
have certificates for their Diffie-Hellman parameters, they can
authenticate each other. If just one has a certificate, then just that
one can be authenticated. This is useful in some situations; for
example, when one participant is a web server and the other is an
arbitrary client, the client can authenticate the web server and
establish a secret key for confidentiality before sending a credit card
number to the web server.</p>
