<h1>1.2 Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We have established an ambitious goal for ourselves: to understand how
to build a computer network from the ground up. Our approach to
accomplishing this goal will be to start from first principles and then
ask the kinds of questions we would naturally ask if building an actual
network. At each step, we will use today’s protocols to illustrate
various design choices available to us, but we will not accept these
existing artifacts as gospel. Instead, we will be asking (and answering)
the question of <em>why</em> networks are designed the way they are. While it
is tempting to settle&nbsp;for just understanding the way it’s done today, it
is important to recognize the underlying concepts because networks are
constantly changing as technology evolves and new applications are
invented. It is our experience that once you understand the fundamental
ideas, any new protocol that you are confronted with will be relatively
easy to digest.</p>
<div class="section" id="stakeholders">
<h2>Stakeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#stakeholders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we noted above, a student of networks can take several perspectives.
When we wrote the first edition of this book, the majority of the
population had no Internet access at all, and those who did obtained it
while at work, at a university, or by a dial-up modem at home. The set
of popular applications could be counted on one’s fingers. Thus, like
most books at the time, ours focused on the perspective of someone who
would design networking equipment and protocols. We continue to focus on
this perspective, and our hope is that after reading this book you will
know how to design the networking equipment and protocols of the future.</p>
<p>However, we also want to cover the perspectives of two additional
stakeholders: those who develop networked applications and those who
manage or operate networks. Let’s consider how these three stakeholders
might list their requirements for a network:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An <em>application programmer</em> would list the services that his or her
application needs: for example, a guarantee that each message the
application sends will be delivered without error within a certain
amount of time or the ability to switch gracefully among different
connections to the network as the user moves around.</li>
<li>A <em>network operator</em> would list the characteristics of a system that
is easy to administer and manage: for example, in which faults can be
easily isolated, new devices can be added to the network and
configured correctly, and it is easy to account for usage.</li>
<li>A <em>network designer</em> would list the properties of a cost-effective
design: for example, that network resources are efficiently utilized
and fairly allocated to different users. Issues of performance are
also likely to be important.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section attempts to distill the requirements of different
stakeholders into a high-level introduction to the major considerations
that drive network design and, in doing so, identify the challenges
addressed throughout the rest of this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scalable-connectivity">
<h2>Scalable Connectivity<a class="headerlink" href="#scalable-connectivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Starting with the obvious, a network must provide connectivity among a
set of computers. Sometimes it is enough to build a limited network that
connects only a few select machines. In fact, for reasons of privacy and
security, many private (corporate) networks have the explicit goal of
limiting the set of machines that are connected. In contrast, other
networks (of which the Internet is the prime example) are designed to
grow in a way that allows them the potential to connect all the
computers in the world. A system that is designed to support growth to
an arbitrarily large size is said to <em>scale</em>. Using the Internet as a
model, this book addresses the challenge of scalability.</p>
<p>To understand the requirements of connectivity more fully, we need to
take a closer look at how computers are connected in a network.
Connectivity occurs at many different levels. At the lowest level, a
network can consist of two or more computers directly connected by some
physical medium, such as a coaxial cable or an optical fiber. We call
such a physical medium a <em>link</em>, and we often refer to the computers it
connects as <em>nodes</em>. (Sometimes a node is a more specialized piece of
hardware rather than a computer, but we overlook that distinction for
the purposes of this discussion.) As illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-direct"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2</span></a>, physical links are sometimes limited to a pair of nodes
(such a link is said to be <em>point-to-point</em>), while in other cases more
than two nodes may share a single physical link (such a link is said to
be <em>multiple-access</em>). Wireless links, such as those provided by
cellular networks and Wi-Fi networks, are an important class of
multiple-access links. It is always the case that multiple-access links
are limited in size, in terms of both the geographical distance they can
cover and the number of nodes they can connect. For this reason, they
often implement the so-called <em>last mile</em>, connecting end users to the
rest of the network.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-direct"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f01-02-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f01-02-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f01-02-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 2. </span><span class="caption-text">Direct links: (a) point-to-point; (b) multiple-access.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If computer networks were limited to situations in which all nodes are
directly connected to each other over a common physical medium, then
either networks would be very limited in the number of computers they
could connect, or the number of wires coming out of the back of each
node would quickly become both unmanageable and very expensive.
Fortunately, connectivity between two nodes does not necessarily imply a
direct physical connection between them—indirect connectivity may be
achieved among a set of cooperating nodes. Consider the following two
examples of how a collection of computers can be indirectly connected.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-psn"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 3</span></a> shows a set of nodes,
each of which is attached to one or more point-to-point links. Those
nodes that are attached to at least two links run software that
forwards data received on one link out on another. If organized in a
systematic way, these forwarding nodes form a <em>switched
network</em>. There are numerous types of switched networks, of which the
two most common are <em>circuit switched</em> and <em>packet switched</em>. The
former is most notably employed by the telephone system, while the
latter is used for the overwhelming majority of computer networks and
will be the focus of this book. (Circuit switching is, however, making
a bit of a comeback in the optical networking realm, which turns out
to be important as demand for network capacity constantly grows.) The
important feature of packet-switched networks is that the nodes in
such a network send discrete blocks of data to each other. Think of
these blocks of data as corresponding to some piece of application
data such as a file, a piece of email, or an image. We call each block
of data either a <em>packet</em> or a <em>message</em>, and for now we use these
terms interchangeably.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<span id="fig-psn"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f01-03-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f01-03-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f01-03-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 3. </span><span class="caption-text">Switched network.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Packet-switched networks typically use a strategy called
<em>store-and-forward</em>. As the name suggests, each node in a
store-and-forward network first receives a complete packet over some
link, stores the packet in its internal memory, and then forwards the
complete packet to the next node. In contrast, a circuit-switched
network first establishes a dedicated circuit across a sequence of links
and then allows the source node to send a stream of bits across this
circuit to a destination node. The major reason for using packet
switching rather than circuit switching in a computer network is
efficiency, discussed in the next subsection.</p>
<p>The cloud in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-psn"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 3</span></a> distinguishes between the
nodes on the inside that <em>implement</em> the network (they are commonly
called <em>switches</em>, and their primary function is to store and forward
packets) and the nodes on the outside of the cloud that <em>use</em> the
network (they are traditionally called <em>hosts</em>, and they support users
and run application programs). Also note that the cloud is one of the
most important icons of computer networking. In general, we use a
cloud to denote any type of network, whether it is a single
point-to-point link, a multiple-access link, or a switched
network. Thus, whenever you see a cloud used in a figure, you can
think of it as a placeholder for any of the networking technologies
covered in this book.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 4. </span><span class="caption-text">Interconnection of networks.</span></p>
</div>
<p>A second way in which a set of computers can be indirectly connected
is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-internet-cloud"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 4</span></a>. In this
situation, a set of independent networks (clouds) are interconnected
to form an <em>internetwork</em>, or internet for short. We adopt the
Internet’s convention of referring to a generic internetwork of
networks as a lowercase <em>i</em> internet, and the TCP/IP Internet we all
use every day as the capital <em>I</em> Internet. A node that is connected
to two or more networks is commonly called a <em>router</em> or <em>gateway</em>,
and it plays much the same role as a switch—it forwards messages from
one network to another. Note that an internet can itself be viewed as
another kind of network, which means that an internet can be built
from a set of internets.  Thus, we can recursively build arbitrarily
large networks by interconnecting clouds to form larger clouds. It can
reasonably be argued that this idea of interconnecting widely
differing networks was the fundamental innovation of the Internet and
that the successful growth of the Internet to global size and billions
of nodes was the result of some very good design decisions by the
early Internet architects, which we will discuss later.</p>
<p>Just because a set of hosts are directly or indirectly connected to each
other does not mean that we have succeeded in providing host-to-host
connectivity. The final requirement is that each node must be able to
say which of the other nodes on the network it wants to communicate
with. This is done by assigning an <em>address</em> to each node. An address is
a byte string that identifies a node; that is, the network can use a
node’s address to distinguish it from the other nodes connected to the
network. When a source node wants the network to deliver a message to a
certain destination node, it specifies the address of the destination
node. If the sending and receiving nodes are not directly connected,
then the switches and routers of the network use this address to decide
how to forward the message toward the destination. The process of
determining systematically how to forward messages toward the
destination node based on its address is called <em>routing</em>.</p>
<p>This brief introduction to addressing and routing has presumed that the
source node wants to send a message to a single destination node
(<em>unicast</em>). While this is the most common scenario, it is also possible
that the source node might want to <em>broadcast</em> a message to all the
nodes on the network. Or, a source node might want to send a message to
some subset of the other nodes but not all of them, a situation called
<em>multicast</em>. Thus, in addition to node-specific addresses, another
requirement of a network is that it supports multicast and broadcast
addresses.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-nested">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">The main idea to take away from this discussion is that we can
define a <em>network</em> recursively as consisting of two or more nodes
connected by a physical link, or as two or more networks connected
by a node. In other words, a network can be constructed from a
nesting of networks, where at the bottom level, the network is
implemented by some physical medium. Among the key challenges in
providing network connectivity are the definition of an address for
each node that is reachable on the network (be it logical or
physical), and the use of such addresses to forward messages toward
the appropriate destination node(s). <a class="reference internal" href="#key-stat-mux"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>

<div class="section" id="cost-effective-resource-sharing">
<h2>Cost-Effective Resource Sharing<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-effective-resource-sharing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As stated above, this book focuses on packet-switched networks. This
section explains the key requirement of computer
networks—efficiency—that leads us to packet switching as the strategy of
choice.</p>
<p>Given a collection of nodes indirectly connected by a nesting of
networks, it is possible for any pair of hosts to send messages to each
other across a sequence of links and nodes. Of course, we want to do
more than support just one pair of communicating hosts—we want to
provide all pairs of hosts with the ability to exchange messages. The
question, then, is how do all the hosts that want to communicate share
the network, especially if they want to use it at the same time? And, as
if that problem isn’t hard enough, how do several hosts share the same
<em>link</em> when they all want to use it at the same time?</p>
<p>To understand how hosts share a network, we need to introduce a
fundamental concept, <em>multiplexing</em>, which means that a system resource
is shared among multiple users. At an intuitive level, multiplexing can
be explained by analogy to a timesharing computer system, where a single
physical processor is shared (multiplexed) among multiple jobs, each of
which believes it has its own private processor. Similarly, data being
sent by multiple users can be multiplexed over the physical links that
make up a network.</p>
<p>To see how this might work, consider the simple network illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mux"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 5</span></a>, where the three hosts on the left side
of the network (senders S1-S3) are sending data to the three hosts on
the right (receivers R1-R3) by sharing a switched network that
contains only one physical link. (For simplicity, assume that host S1
is sending data to host R1, and so on.) In this situation, three flows
of data—corresponding to the three pairs of hosts—are multiplexed onto
a single physical link by switch&nbsp;1 and then <em>demultiplexed</em> back into
separate flows by switch&nbsp;2. Note that we are being intentionally vague
about exactly what a “flow of data” corresponds to. For the purposes
of this discussion, assume that each host on the left has a large
supply of data that it wants to send to its counterpart on the right.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-mux"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f01-05-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f01-05-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f01-05-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 5. </span><span class="caption-text">Multiplexing multiple logical flows over a single
physical link.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are several different methods for multiplexing multiple flows onto
one physical link. One common method is <em>synchronous time-division
multiplexing</em> (STDM). The idea of STDM is to divide time into
equal-sized quanta and, in a round-robin fashion, give each flow a
chance to send its data over the physical link. In other words, during
time quantum 1, data from S1 to R1 is transmitted; during time quantum
2, data from S2 to R2 is transmitted; in quantum 3, S3 sends data to R3.
At this point, the first flow (S1 to R1) gets to go again, and the
process repeats. Another method is <em>frequency-division multiplexing</em>
(FDM). The idea of FDM is to transmit each flow over the physical link
at a different frequency, much the same way that the signals for
different TV stations are transmitted at a different frequency over the
airwaves or on a coaxial cable TV link.</p>
<p>Although simple to understand, both STDM and FDM are limited in two
ways. First, if one of the flows (host pairs) does not have any data to
send, its share of the physical link—that is, its time quantum or its
frequency—remains idle, even if one of the other flows has data to
transmit. For example, S3 had to wait its turn behind S1 and S2 in the
previous paragraph, even if S1 and S2 had nothing to send. For computer
communication, the amount of time that a link is idle can be very
large—for example, consider the amount of time you spend reading a web
page (leaving the link idle) compared to the time you spend fetching the
page. Second, both STDM and FDM are limited to situations in which the
maximum number of flows is fixed and known ahead of time. It is not
practical to resize the quantum or to add additional quanta in the case
of STDM or to add new frequencies in the case of FDM.</p>
<p>The form of multiplexing that addresses these shortcomings, and of which
we make most use in this book, is called <em>statistical multiplexing</em>.
Although the name is not all that helpful for understanding the concept,
statistical multiplexing is really quite simple, with two key ideas.
First, it is like STDM in that the physical link is shared over
time—first data from one flow is transmitted over the physical link,
then data from another flow is transmitted, and so on. Unlike STDM,
however, data is transmitted from each flow on demand rather than during
a predetermined time slot. Thus, if only one flow has data to send, it
gets to transmit that data without waiting for its quantum to come
around and thus without having to watch the quanta assigned to the other
flows go by unused. It is this avoidance of idle time that gives packet
switching its efficiency.</p>
<p>As defined so far, however, statistical multiplexing has no mechanism to
ensure that all the flows eventually get their turn to transmit over the
physical link. That is, once a flow begins sending data, we need some
way to limit the transmission, so that the other flows can have a turn.
To account for this need, statistical multiplexing defines an upper
bound on the size of the block of data that each flow is permitted to
transmit at a given time. This limited-size block of data is typically
referred to as a <em>packet</em>, to distinguish it from the arbitrarily large
<em>message</em> that an application program might want to transmit. Because a
packet-switched network limits the maximum size of packets, a host may
not be able to send a complete message in one packet. The source may
need to fragment the message into several packets, with the receiver
reassembling the packets back into the original message.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 6. </span><span class="caption-text">A switch multiplexing packets from multiple sources

</div>
<p>In other words, each flow sends a sequence of packets over the
physical link, with a decision made on a packet-by-packet basis as to
which flow’s packet to send next. Notice that, if only one flow has
data to send, then it can send a sequence of packets back-to-back;
however, should more than one of the flows have data to send, then
their packets are interleaved on the link. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-statmux"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 6</span></a> depicts a switch multiplexing packets from multiple
sources onto a single shared link.</p>
<p>The decision as to which packet to send next on a shared link can be
made in a number of different ways. For example, in a network consisting
of switches interconnected by links such as the one in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mux"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
5</span></a>, the decision would be made by the switch that transmits
packets onto the shared link. (As we will see later, not all
packet-switched networks actually involve switches, and they may use
other mechanisms to determine whose packet goes onto the link next.)
Each switch in a packet-switched network makes this decision
independently, on a packet-by-packet basis. One of the issues that faces
a network designer is how to make this decision in a fair manner. For
example, a switch could be designed to service packets on a first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis. Another approach would be to transmit the
packets from each of the different flows that are currently sending data
through the switch in a round-robin manner. This might be done to ensure
that certain flows receive a particular share of the link’s bandwidth or
that they never have their packets delayed in the switch for more than a
certain length of time. A network that attempts to allocate bandwidth to
particular flows is sometimes said to support <em>quality of service</em>
(QoS).</p>
<p>Also, notice in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-statmux"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 6</span></a> that since the
switch has to multiplex three incoming packet streams onto one
outgoing link, it is possible that the switch will receive packets
faster than the shared link can accommodate. In this case, the switch
is forced to buffer these packets in its memory. Should a switch
receive packets faster than it can send them for an extended period of
time, then the switch will eventually run out of buffer space, and
some packets will have to be dropped. When a switch is operating in
this state, it is said to be <em>congested</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-stat-mux">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">The bottom line is that statistical multiplexing defines a
cost-effective way for multiple users (e.g., host-to-host flows of
data) to share network resources (links and nodes) in a fine-grained
manner. It defines the packet as the granularity with which the
links of the network are allocated to different flows, with each
switch able to schedule the use of the physical links it is
connected to on a per-packet basis. Fairly allocating link capacity
to different flows and dealing with congestion when it occurs are
the key challenges of statistical multiplexing. <a class="reference internal" href="#key-semantic-gap"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>

<h2>Support for Common Services<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-common-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The previous discussion focused on the challenges involved in providing
cost-effective connectivity among a group of hosts, but it is overly
simplistic to view a computer network as simply delivering packets among
a collection of computers. It is more accurate to think of a network as
providing the means for a set of application processes that are
distributed over those computers to communicate. In other words, the
next requirement of a computer network is that the application programs
running on the hosts connected to the network must be able to
communicate in a meaningful way. From the application developer’s
perspective, the network needs to make his or her life easier.</p>
<p>When two application programs need to communicate with each other, a lot
of complicated things must happen beyond simply sending a message from
one host to another. One option would be for application designers to
build all that complicated functionality into each application program.
However, since many applications need common services, it is much more
logical to implement those common services once and then to let the
application designer build the application using those services. The
challenge for a network designer is to identify the right set of common
services. The goal is to hide the complexity of the network from the
application without overly constraining the application designer.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 7. </span><span class="caption-text">Processes communicating over an abstract channel.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, we view the network as providing logical <em>channels</em> over
which application-level processes can communicate with each other; each
channel provides the set of services required by that application. In
other words, just as we use a cloud to abstractly represent connectivity
among a set of computers, we now think of a channel as connecting one
process to another. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-channel"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 7</span></a> shows a pair of
application-level processes communicating over a logical channel that
is, in turn, implemented on top of a cloud that connects a set of hosts.
We can think of the channel as being like a pipe connecting two
applications, so that a sending application can put data in one end and
expect that data to be delivered by the network to the application at
the other end of the pipe.</p>
<p>Like any abstraction, logical process-to-process channels are
implemented on top of a collection of physical host-to-host
channels. This is the essense of layering, the cornerstone of network
architectures discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>The challenge is to recognize what functionality the channels should
provide to application programs. For example, does the application
require a guarantee that messages sent over the channel are delivered,
or is it acceptable if some messages fail to arrive? Is it necessary
that messages arrive at the recipient process in the same order in which
they are sent, or does the recipient not care about the order in which
messages arrive? Does the network need to ensure that no third parties
are able to eavesdrop on the channel, or is privacy not a concern? In
general, a network provides a variety of different types of channels,
with each application selecting the type that best meets its needs. The
rest of this section illustrates the thinking involved in defining
useful channels.</p>
<div class="section" id="identify-common-communication-patterns">
<h3>Identify Common Communication Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-common-communication-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Designing abstract channels involves first understanding the
communication needs of a representative collection of applications, then
extracting their common communication requirements, and finally
incorporating the functionality that meets these requirements in the
network.</p>
<p>One of the earliest applications supported on any network is a file
access program like the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Network File
System (NFS). Although many details vary—for example, whether whole
files are transferred across the network or only single blocks of the
file are read/written at a given time—the communication component of
remote file access is characterized by a pair of processes, one that
requests that a file be read or written and a second process that honors
this request. The process that requests access to the file is called the
<em>client</em>, and the process that supports access to the file is called the
<em>server</em>.</p>
<p>Reading a file involves the client sending a small request message to a
server and the server responding with a large message that contains the
data in the file. Writing works in the opposite way—the client sends a
large message containing the data to be written to the server, and the
server responds with a small message confirming that the write to disk
has taken place.</p>
<p>A digital library is a more sophisticated application than file
transfer, but it requires similar communication services. For example,
the <em>Association for Computing Machinery</em> (ACM) operates a large digital
library of computer science literature at</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This library has a wide range of searching and browsing features to help
users find the articles they want, but ultimately much of what it does
is respond to user requests for files, such as electronic copies of
journal articles.</p>
<p>Using file access, a digital library, and the two video applications
described in the introduction (videoconferencing and video on demand) as
a representative sample, we might decide to provide the following two
types of channels: <em>request/reply</em> channels and <em>message stream</em>
channels. The request/reply channel would be used by the file transfer
and digital library applications. It would guarantee that every message
sent by one side is received by the other side and that only one copy of
each message is delivered. The request/reply channel might also protect
the privacy and integrity of the data that flows over it, so that
unauthorized parties cannot read or modify the data being exchanged
between the client and server processes.</p>
<p>The message stream channel could be used by both the video on demand and
videoconferencing applications, provided it is parameterized to support
both one-way and two-way traffic and to support different delay
properties. The message stream channel might not need to guarantee that
all messages are delivered, since a video application can operate
adequately even if some video frames are not received. It would,
however, need to ensure that those messages that are delivered arrive in
the same order in which they were sent, to avoid displaying frames out
of sequence. Like the request/reply channel, the message stream channel
might want to ensure the privacy and integrity of the video data.
Finally, the message stream channel might need to support multicast, so
that multiple parties can participate in the teleconference or view the
video.</p>
<p>While it is common for a network designer to strive for the smallest
number of abstract channel types that can serve the largest number of
applications, there is a danger in trying to get away with too few
channel abstractions. Simply stated, if you have a hammer, then
everything looks like a nail. For example, if all you have are message
stream and request/reply channels, then it is tempting to use them for
the next application that comes along, even if neither type provides
exactly the semantics needed by the application. Thus, network designers
will probably be inventing new types of channels—and adding options to
existing channels—for as long as application programmers are inventing
new applications.</p>
<p>Also note that independent of exactly <em>what</em> functionality a given
channel provides, there is the question of <em>where</em> that functionality is
implemented. In many cases, it is easiest to view the host-to-host
connectivity of the underlying network as simply providing a <em>bit pipe</em>,
with any high-level communication semantics provided at the end hosts.
The advantage of this approach is that it keeps the switches in the
middle of the network as simple as possible—they simply forward
packets—but it requires the end hosts to take on much of the burden of
supporting semantically rich process-to-process channels. The
alternative is to push additional functionality onto the switches,
thereby allowing the end hosts to be “dumb” devices (e.g., telephone
handsets). We will see this question of how various network services are
partitioned between the packet switches and the end hosts (devices) as a
recurring issue in network design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliable-message-delivery">
<h3>Reliable Message Delivery<a class="headerlink" href="#reliable-message-delivery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As suggested by the examples just considered, reliable message delivery
is one of the most important functions that a network can provide. It is
difficult to determine how to provide this reliability, however, without
first understanding how networks can fail. The first thing to recognize
is that computer networks do not exist in a perfect world. Machines
crash and later are rebooted, fibers are cut, electrical interference
corrupts bits in the data being transmitted, switches run out of buffer
space, and, as if these sorts of physical problems aren’t enough to
worry about, the software that manages the hardware may contain bugs and
sometimes forwards packets into oblivion. Thus, a major requirement of a
network is to recover from certain kinds of failures, so that
application programs don’t have to deal with them or even be aware of
them.</p>
<p>There are three general classes of failure that network designers have
to worry about. First, as a packet is transmitted over a physical link,
<em>bit errors</em> may be introduced into the data; that is, a 1 is turned
into a 0 or <em>vice versa</em>. Sometimes single bits are corrupted, but more
often than not a <em>burst error</em> occurs—several consecutive bits are
corrupted. Bit errors typically occur because outside forces, such as
lightning strikes, power surges, and microwave ovens, interfere with the
transmission of data. The good news is that such bit errors are fairly
rare, affecting on average only one out of every 10<sup>6</sup> to
10<sup>7</sup> bits on a typical copper-based cable and one out of every
10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>14</sup> bits on a typical optical fiber.
As we will see, there are techniques that detect these bit errors with
high probability. Once detected, it is sometimes possible to correct for
such errors—if we know which bit or bits are corrupted, we can simply
flip them—while in other cases the damage is so bad that it is necessary
to discard the entire packet. In such a case, the sender may be expected
to retransmit the packet.</p>
<p>The second class of failure is at the packet, rather than the bit,
level; that is, a complete packet is lost by the network. One reason
this can happen is that the packet contains an uncorrectable bit error
and therefore has to be discarded. A more likely reason, however, is
that one of the nodes that has to handle the packet—for example, a
switch that is forwarding it from one link to another—is so overloaded
that it has no place to store the packet and therefore is forced to drop
it. This is the problem of congestion just discussed. Less commonly, the
software running on one of the nodes that handles the packet makes a
mistake. For example, it might incorrectly forward a packet out on the
wrong link, so that the packet never finds its way to the ultimate
destination. As we will see, one of the main difficulties in dealing
with lost packets is distinguishing between a packet that is indeed lost
and one that is merely late in arriving at the destination.</p>
<p>The third class of failure is at the node and link level; that is, a
physical link is cut, or the computer it is connected to crashes. This
can be caused by software that crashes, a power failure, or a reckless
backhoe operator. Failures due to misconfiguration of a network device
are also common. While any of these failures can eventually be
corrected, they can have a dramatic effect on the network for an
extended period of time. However, they need not totally disable the
network. In a packet-switched network, for example, it is sometimes
possible to route around a failed node or link. One of the difficulties
in dealing with this third class of failure is distinguishing between a
failed computer and one that is merely slow or, in the case of a link,
between one that has been cut and one that is very flaky and therefore
introducing a high number of bit errors.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-semantic-gap">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">The key idea to take away from this discussion is that defining
useful channels involves both understanding the applications’
requirements and recognizing the limitations of the underlying
technology. The challenge is to fill in the gap between what the
application expects and what the underlying technology can provide.

<div class="section" id="manageability">
<h2>Manageability<a class="headerlink" href="#manageability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A final requirement, which seems to be neglected or left till last all
too often (as we do here), is that networks need to be managed. Managing
a network includes upgrading equipment as the network grows to carry
more traffic or reach more users, troubleshooting the network when
things go wrong or performance isn’t as desired, and adding new features
in support of new applications. Network management has historically
been a human-intensive aspect of networking, and while it is ulikely
we’ll get people entirely out of the loop, it is increasingly being
addressed by automation and self-healing designs.</p>
<p>This requirement is partly related to the issue of scalability discussed
above—as the Internet has scaled up to support billions of users and at
least hundreds of millions of hosts, the challenges of keeping the whole
thing running correctly and correctly configuring new devices as they
are added have become increasingly problematic. Configuring a single
router in a network is often a task for a trained expert; configuring
thousands of routers and figuring out why a network of such a size is
not behaving as expected can become a task beyond any single human.
This is why automation is becoming so important.</p>
<p>One way to make a network easier to manage is to avoid change. Once the
network is working, simply <em>do not touch it!</em> This mindset exposes the
fundamental tension between <em>stability</em> and <em>feature velocity</em>: the rate
at which new capabilities are introduced into the network. Favoring
stability is the approach the telecommunications industry (not to
mention University system administrators and corporate IT departments)
adopted for many years, making it one of the most slow moving and risk
averse industries you will find anywhere. But the recent explosion of
the cloud has changed that dynamic, making it necessary to bring
stability and feature velocity more into balance. The impact of the
cloud on the network is a topic that comes up over and over throughout
the book, and one we pay particular attention to in the <em>Perspectives</em>
section at the end of each chapter. For now, suffice it to say that
managing a rapidly evolving network is arguably <em>the</em> central challenge
in networking today.</p>
