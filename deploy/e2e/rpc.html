<p>A common pattern of communication used by application programs
structured as a <em>client/server</em> pair is the request/reply message
transaction: A client sends a request message to a server, and the
server responds with a reply message, with the client blocking
(suspending execution) to wait for the reply. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rpc-timeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure

client and server in such an exchange.</p>

<p>A transport protocol that supports the request/reply paradigm is much
more than a UDP message going in one direction followed by a UDP message
going in the other direction. It needs to deal with correctly
identifying processes on remote hosts and correlating requests with
responses. It may also need to overcome some or all of the limitations
of the underlying network outlined in the problem statement at the
beginning of this chapter. While TCP overcomes these limitations by
providing a reliable byte-stream service, it doesn’t perfectly match the
request/reply paradigm either. This section describes a third category
of transport protocol, called <em>Remote Procedure Call</em> (RPC), that more
closely matches the needs of an application involved in a request/reply
message exchange.</p>
<div class="section" id="rpc-fundamentals">
<h2>RPC Fundamentals<a class="headerlink" href="#rpc-fundamentals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>RPC is not technically a protocol—it is better thought of as a general
mechanism for structuring distributed systems. RPC is popular because it
is based on the semantics of a local procedure call—the application
program makes a call into a procedure without regard for whether it is
local or remote and blocks until the call returns. An application
developer can be largely unaware of whether the procedure is local or
remote, simplifying his task considerably. When the procedures being
called are actually methods of remote objects in an object-oriented
language, RPC is known as <em>remote method invocation</em> (RMI). While the
RPC concept is simple, there are two main problems that make it more
complicated than local procedure calls:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The network between the calling process and the called process has
much more complex properties than the backplane of a computer. For
example, it is likely to limit message sizes and has a tendency to
lose and reorder messages.</li>
<li>The computers on which the calling and called processes run may have
significantly different architectures and data representation
formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a complete RPC mechanism actually involves two major components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A protocol that manages the messages sent between the client and the
server processes and that deals with the potentially undesirable
properties of the underlying network.</li>
<li>Programming language and compiler support to package the arguments
into a request message on the client machine and then to translate
this message back into the arguments on the server machine, and
likewise with the return value (this piece of the RPC mechanism is
usually called a <em>stub compiler</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rpc-stub"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 138</span></a> schematically depicts what happens
when a client invokes a remote procedure. First, the client calls a
local stub for the procedure, passing it the arguments required by the
procedure.  This stub hides the fact that the procedure is remote by
translating the arguments into a request message and then invoking an
RPC protocol to send the request message to the server machine. At the
server, the RPC protocol delivers the request message to the server
stub, which translates it into the arguments to the procedure and then
calls the local procedure. After the server procedure completes, it
returns in a reply message that it hands off to the RPC protocol for
transmission back to the client. The RPC protocol on the client passes
this message up to the client stub, which translates it into a return
value that it returns to the client program.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 138. </span><span class="caption-text">Complete RPC mechanism.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This section considers just the protocol-related aspects of an RPC
mechanism. That is, it ignores the stubs and focuses instead on the RPC
protocol, sometimes referred to as a request/reply protocol, that
transmits messages between client and server. The transformation of
arguments into messages and <em>vice versa</em> is covered elsewhere. It is
also important to keep in mind that the client and server programs are
written in some programming language, meaning that a given RPC mechanism
might support Python stubs, Java stubs, GoLang stubs, and so on, each of
which includes language-specific idioms for how procedures are invoked.</p>
<p>The term <em>RPC</em> refers to a type of protocol rather than a specific
standard like TCP, so specific RPC protocols vary in the functions they
perform. And, unlike TCP, which is the dominant reliable byte-stream
protocol, there is no one dominant RPC protocol. Thus, in this section
we will talk more about alternative design choices than previously.</p>
<div class="section" id="identifiers-in-rpc">
<h3>Identifiers in RPC<a class="headerlink" href="#identifiers-in-rpc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two functions that must be performed by any RPC protocol are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Provide a name space for uniquely identifying the procedure to be
called.</li>
<li>Match each reply message to the corresponding request message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first problem has some similarities to the problem of identifying
nodes in a network, something IP addresses do, for example). One of the
design choices when identifying things is whether to make this name
space flat or hierarchical. A flat name space would simply assign a
unique, unstructured identifier (e.g., an integer) to each procedure,
and this number would be carried in a single field in an RPC request
message. This would require some kind of central coordination to avoid
assigning the same procedure number to two different procedures.
Alternatively, the protocol could implement a hierarchical name space,
analogous to that used for file pathnames, which requires only that a
file’s “basename” be unique within its directory. This approach
potentially simplifies the job of ensuring uniqueness of procedure
names. A hierarchical name space for RPC could be implemented by
defining a set of fields in the request message format, one for each
level of naming in, say, a two- or three-level hierarchical name space.</p>
<p>The key to matching a reply message to the corresponding request is to
uniquely identify request-replies pairs using a message ID field. A
reply message had its message ID field set to the same value as the
request message. When the client RPC module receives the reply, it uses
the message ID to search for the corresponding outstanding request. To
make the RPC transaction appear like a local procedure call to the
caller, the caller is blocked until the reply message is received. When
the reply is received, the blocked caller is identified based on the
request number in the reply, the remote procedure’s return value is
obtained from the reply, and the caller is unblocked so that it can
return with that return value.</p>
<p>One of the recurrent challenges in RPC is dealing with unexpected
responses, and we see this with message IDs. For example, consider the
following pathological (but realistic) situation. A client machine sends
a request message with a message ID of 0, then crashes and reboots, and
then sends an unrelated request message, also with a message ID of 0.
The server may not have been aware that the client crashed and rebooted
and, upon seeing a request message with a message ID of 0, acknowledges
it and discards it as a duplicate. The client never gets a response to
the request.</p>
<p>One way to eliminate this problem is to use a <em>boot ID</em>. A machine’s
boot ID is a number that is incremented each time the machine reboots;
this number is read from nonvolatile storage (e.g., a disk or flash
drive), incremented, and written back to the storage device during the
machine’s start-up procedure. This number is then put in every message
sent by that host. If a message is received with an old message ID but a
new boot ID, it is recognized as a new message. In effect, the message
ID and boot ID combine to form a unique ID for each transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overcoming-network-limitations">
<h3>Overcoming Network Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#overcoming-network-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>RPC protocols often perform additional functions to deal with the fact
that networks are not perfect channels. Two such functions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Provide reliable message delivery</li>
<li>Support large message sizes through fragmentation and reassembly</li>
</ul>
<p>An RPC protocol might “define this problem away” by choosing to run on
top of a reliable protocol like TCP, but in many cases, the RCP protocol
implements its own reliable message delivery layer on top of an
unreliable substrate (e.g., UDP/IP). Such an RPC protocol would likely
implement reliability using acknowledgments and timeouts, similarly to
TCP.</p>
<p>The basic algorithm is straightforward, as illustrated by the timeline
given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-chan-timeline1"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 139</span></a>. The client sends a
request message and the server acknowledges it. Then, after executing
the procedure, the server sends a reply message and the client
acknowledges the reply.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-chan-timeline1"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f05-15-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f05-15-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f05-15-9780123850591.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 139. </span><span class="caption-text">Simple timeline for a reliable RPC protocol.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Either a message carrying data (a request message or a reply message) or
the ACK sent to acknowledge that message may be lost in the network. To
account for this possibility, both client and server save a copy of each
message they send until an ACK for it has arrived. Each side also sets a
RETRANSMIT timer and resends the message should this timer expire. Both
sides reset this timer and try again some agreed-upon number of times
before giving up and freeing the message.</p>
<p>If an RPC client receives a reply message, clearly the corresponding
request message must have been received by the server. Hence, the reply
message itself is an <em>implicit acknowledgment</em>, and any additional
acknowledgment from the server is not logically necessary. Similarly, a
request message could implicitly acknowledge the preceding reply
message—assuming the protocol makes request-reply transactions
sequential, so that one transaction must complete before the next
begins. Unfortunately, this sequentiality would severely limit RPC
performance.</p>
<p>A way out of this predicament is for the RPC protocol to implement a
<em>channel</em> abstraction. Within a given channel, request/reply
transactions are sequential—there can be only one transaction active on
a given channel at any given time—but there can be multiple channels. Or
said another way, the channel abstraction makes it possible to
<em>multiplex</em> multiple RPC request/reply transactions between a
client/server pair.</p>
<p>Each message includes a channel ID field to indicate which channel the
message belongs to. A request message in a given channel would
implicitly acknowledge the previous reply in that channel, if it
hadn’t already been acknowledged. An application program can open
multiple channels to a server if it wants to have more than one
request/reply transaction between them at the same time (the
application would need multiple threads). As illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-implicitacktimeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 140</span></a>, the reply message
serves to acknowledge the request message, and a subsequent request
acknowledges the preceding reply. Note that we saw a very similar
approach—called <em>concurrent logical channels</em>—in an earlier section as
a way to improve on the performance of a stop-and-wait reliability
mechanism.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-implicitacktimeline"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f05-16-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f05-16-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f05-16-9780123850591.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 140. </span><span class="caption-text">Timeline for a reliable RPC protocol using implicit
acknowledgment.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Another complication that RPC must address is that the server may take
an arbitrarily long time to produce the result, and, worse yet, it may
crash before generating the reply. Keep in mind that we are talking
about the period of time after the server has acknowledged the request
but before it has sent the reply. To help the client distinguish between
a slow server and a dead server, the RPC’s client side can periodically
send an “Are you alive?” message to the server, and the server side
responds with an ACK. Alternatively, the server could send “I am still
alive” messages to the client without the client having first solicited
them. The approach is more scalable because it puts more of the
per-client burden (managing the timeout timer) on the clients.</p>
<p>RPC reliability may include the property known as <em>at-most-once
semantics</em>. This means that for every request message that the client
sends, at most one copy of that message is delivered to the server. Each
time the client calls a remote procedure, that procedure is invoked at
most one time on the server machine. We say “at most once” rather than
“exactly once” because it is always possible that either the network or
the server machine has failed, making it impossible to deliver even one
copy of the request message.</p>
<p>To implement at-most-once semantics, RPC on the server side must
recognize duplicate requests (and ignore them), even if it has already
successfully replied to the original request. Hence, it must maintain
some state information that identifies past requests. One approach is to
identify requests using sequence numbers, so a server need only remember
the most recent sequence number. Unfortunately, this would limit an RPC
to one outstanding request (to a given server) at a time, since one
request must be completed before the request with the next sequence
number can be transmitted. Once again, channels provide a solution. The
server could recognize duplicate requests by remembering the current
sequence number for each channel, without limiting the client to one
request at a&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>As obvious as at-most-once sounds, not all RPC protocols support this
behavior. Some support a semantics that is facetiously called
<em>zero-or-more</em> semantics; that is, each invocation on a client results
in the remote procedure being invoked zero or more times. It is not
difficult to understand how this would cause problems for a remote
procedure that changed some local state variable (e.g., incremented a
counter) or that had some externally visible side effect (e.g., launched
a missile) each time it was invoked. On the other hand, if the remote
procedure being invoked is <em>idempotent</em>—multiple invocations have the
same effect as just one—then the RPC mechanism need not support
at-most-once semantics; a simpler (possibly faster) implementation will
suffice.</p>
<p>As was the case with reliability, the two reasons why an RPC protocol
might implement message fragmentation and reassembly are that it is not
provided by the underlying protocol stack or that it can be implemented
more efficiently by the RPC protocol. Consider the case where RPC is
implemented on top of UDP/IP and relies on IP for fragmentation and
reassembly. If even one fragment of a message fails to arrive within a
certain amount of time, IP discards the fragments that did arrive and
the message is effectively lost. Eventually, the RPC protocol (assuming
it implements reliability) would time out and retransmit the message. In
contrast, consider an RPC protocol that implements its own fragmentation
and reassembly and aggressively ACKs or NACKs (negatively acknowledges)
individual fragments. Lost fragments would be more quickly detected and
retransmitted, and only the lost fragments would be retransmitted, not
the whole message.</p>

<div class="section" id="synchronous-versus-asynchronous-protocols">
<h3>Synchronous versus Asynchronous Protocols<a class="headerlink" href="#synchronous-versus-asynchronous-protocols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One way to characterize a protocol is by whether it is <em>synchronous</em> or
<em>asynchronous</em>. The precise meaning of these terms depends on where in
the protocol hierarchy you use them. At the transport layer, it is most
accurate to think of them as defining the extremes of a spectrum rather
than as two mutually exclusive alternatives. The key attribute of any
point along the spectrum is how much the sending process knows after the
operation to send a message returns. In other words, if we assume that
an application program invokes a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> operation on a transport
protocol, then exactly what does the application know about the success
of the operation when the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> operation returns?</p>
<p>At the <em>asynchronous</em> end of the spectrum, the application knows
absolutely nothing when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> returns. Not only does it not know if
the message was received by its peer, but it doesn’t even know for sure
that the message has successfully left the local machine. At the
<em>synchronous</em> end of the spectrum, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> operation typically
returns a reply message. That is, the application not only knows that
the message it sent was received by its peer, but it also knows that the
peer has returned an answer. Thus, synchronous protocols implement the
request/reply abstraction, while asynchronous protocols are used if the
sender wants to be able to transmit many messages without having to wait
for a response. Using this definition, RPC protocols are usually
synchronous protocols.</p>
<p>Although we have not discussed them in this chapter, there are
interesting points between these two extremes. For example, the
transport protocol might implement <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> so that it blocks (does not
return) until the message has been successfully received at the remote
machine, but returns before the sender’s peer on that machine has
actually processed and responded to it. This is sometimes called a
<em>reliable datagram protocol</em>.</p>

<h2>RPC Implementations (SunRPC, DCE, gRPC)<a class="headerlink" href="#rpc-implementations-sunrpc-dce-grpc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now turn our discussion to some example implementations of RPC
protocols. These will serve to highlight some of the different design
decisions that protocol designers have made. Our first example is
SunRPC, a widely used RPC protocol also known as Open Network Computing
RPC (ONC RPC). Our second example, which we will refer to as DCE-RPC, is
part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). DCE is a set of
standards and software for building distributed systems that was defined
by the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a consortium of computer
companies that originally included IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation,
and Hewlett-Packard; today, OSF goes by the name The Open Group. Our
third example is gRPC, a popular RPC mechanism that Google has open
sourced, based on an RPC mechanism that they have been using internally
to implement cloud services in their datacenters.</p>
<p>These three examples represent interesting alternative design choices in
the RPC solution space, but least you think they are the only options,
we describe three other RPC-like mechanisms (WSDL, SOAP, and REST) in
the context of web services in Chapter 9.</p>

<h3>SunRPC<a class="headerlink" href="#sunrpc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SunRPC became a <em>de facto</em> standard thanks to its wide distribution with
Sun workstations and the central role it plays in Sun’s popular Network
File System (NFS). The IETF subsequently adopted it as a standard
Internet protocol under the name ONC RPC.</p>
<p>SunRPC can be implemented over several different transport protocols.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sunrpc"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 141</span></a> illustrates the protocol graph when
SunRPC is implemented on UDP. As we noted earlier in this section, a
strict layerist might frown on the idea of running a transport
protocol over a transport protocol, or argue that RPC must be
something other than a transport protocol since it appears “above” the
transport layer.  Pragmatically, the design decision to run RPC over
an existing transport layer makes quite a lot of sense, as will be
apparent in the following discussion.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 141. </span><span class="caption-text">Protocol graph for SunRPC on top of UDP.</span></p>
</div>
<p>SunRPC uses two-tier identifiers to identify remote procedures: a
32-bit program number and a 32-bit procedure number. (There is also a
32-bit version number, but we ignore that in the following
discussion.) For example, the NFS server has been assigned program
number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x00100003</span></code>, and within this program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getattr</span></code> is procedure
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setattr</span></code> is procedure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read</span></code> is procedure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">write</span></code> is procedure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8</span></code>, and so on. The program number and
procedure number are transmitted in the SunRPC request message’s
header, whose fields are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sunrpc-format"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 142</span></a>. The server—which may support several program
numbers—is responsible for calling the specified procedure of the
specified program. A SunRPC request really represents a request to
call the specified program and procedure on the particular machine to
which the request was sent, even though the same program number may be
implemented on other machines in the same network. Thus, the address
of the server’s machine (e.g., an IP address) is an implicit third
tier of the RPC address.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id8">

</div>
<p>Different program numbers may belong to different servers on the same
machine. These different servers have different transport layer demux
keys (e.g., UDP ports), most of which are not well-known numbers but
instead are assigned dynamically. These demux keys are called <em>transport
selectors</em>. How can a SunRPC client that wants to talk to a particular
program determine which transport selector to use to reach the
corresponding server? The solution is to assign a well-known address to
<em>just one</em> program on the remote machine and let that program handle the
task of telling clients which transport selector to use to reach any
other program on the machine. The original version of this SunRPC
program is called the <em>Port Mapper</em>, and it supports only UDP and TCP as
underlying protocols. Its program number is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x00100000</span></code>, and its
well-known port is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">111</span></code>. RPCBIND, which evolved from the Port Mapper,
supports arbitrary underlying transport protocols. As each SunRPC server
starts, it calls an RPCBIND registration procedure, on the server’s own
home machine, to register its transport selector and the program numbers
that it supports. A remote client can then call an RPCBIND lookup
procedure to look up the transport selector for a particular program
number.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, consider an example using the Port Mapper
with UDP. To send a request message to NFS’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read</span></code> procedure, a
client first sends a request message to the Port Mapper at well-known
UDP port&nbsp;<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">111</span></code>, asking that procedure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> be invoked to map
program number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x00100003</span></code> to the UDP port where the NFS program
currently resides. The client then sends a SunRPC request message with
program number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x00100003</span></code> and procedure number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code> to this UDP
port, and the SunRPC module listening at that port calls the NFS
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read</span></code> procedure. The client also caches the program-to-port number
mapping so that it need not go back to the Port Mapper each time it
wants to talk to the NFS program.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>

</table>
<p>To match up a reply message with the corresponding request, so that
the result of the RPC can be returned to the correct caller, both
request and reply message headers include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">XID</span></code> (transaction ID)
field, as in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sunrpc-format"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 142</span></a>. A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">XID</span></code> is a
unique transaction ID used only by one request and the corresponding
reply. After the server has successfully replied to a given request,
it does not remember the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">XID</span></code>. Because of this, SunRPC cannot
guarantee at-most-once semantics.</p>
<p>The details of SunRPC’s semantics depend on the underlying transport
protocol. It does not implement its own reliability, so it is only
reliable if the underlying transport is reliable. (Of course, any
application that runs over SunRPC may also choose to implement its own
reliability mechanisms above the level of SunRPC.) The ability to send
request and reply messages that are larger than the network MTU is also
dependent on the underlying transport. In other words, SunRPC does not
make any attempt to improve on the underlying transport when it comes to
reliability and message size. Since SunRPC can run over many different
transport protocols, this gives it considerable flexibility without
complicating the design of the RPC protocol itself.</p>
<p>Returning to the SunRPC header format of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sunrpc-format"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 142</span></a>, the request message contains variable-length
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Credentials</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Verifier</span></code> fields, both of which are used by the
client to authenticate itself to the server—that is, to give evidence
that the client has the right to invoke the server. How a client
authenticates itself to a server is a general issue that must be
addressed by any protocol that wants to provide a reasonable level of
security. This topic is discussed in more detail in another chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dce-rpc">
<h3>DCE-RPC<a class="headerlink" href="#dce-rpc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>DCE-RPC is the RPC protocol at the core of the DCE system and was the
basis of the RPC mechanism underlying Microsoft’s DCOM and ActiveX. It
can be used with the Network Data Representation (NDR) stub compiler
described in another chapter, but it also serves as the underlying RPC
protocol for the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
which is an industry-wide standard for building distributed,
object-oriented systems.</p>
<p>DCE-RPC, like SunRPC, can be implemented on top of several transport
protocols including UDP and TCP. It is also similar to SunRPC in that it
defines a two-level addressing scheme: the transport protocol
demultiplexes to the correct server, DCE-RPC dispatches to a particular
procedure exported by that server, and clients consult an “endpoint
mapping service” (similar to SunRPC’s Port Mapper) to learn how to reach
a particular server. Unlike SunRPC, however, DCE-RPC implements
at-most-once call semantics. (In truth, DCE-RPC supports multiple call
semantics, including an idempotent semantics similar to SunRPC’s, but
at-most-once is the default behavior.) There are some other differences
between the two approaches, which we will highlight in the following
paragraphs.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id9">
<span id="fig-dce"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f05-19-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f05-19-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f05-19-9780123850591.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 143. </span><span class="caption-text">Typical DCE-RPC message exchange.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dce"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 143</span></a> gives a timeline for the typical exchange of
messages, where each message is labeled by its DCE-RPC type. The client
sends a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Request</span></code> message, the server eventually replies with a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Response</span></code> message, and the client acknowledges (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ack</span></code>) the
response. Instead of the server acknowledging the request messages,
however, the client periodically sends a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ping</span></code> message to the server,
which responds with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Working</span></code> message to indicate that the remote
procedure is still in progress. If the server’s reply is received
reasonably quickly, no <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ping</span></code>s are sent. Although not shown in the
figure, other message types are also supported. For example, the client
can send a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Quit</span></code> message to the server, asking it to abort an earlier
call that is still in progress; the server responds with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Quack</span></code>
(quit acknowledgment) message. Also, the server can respond to a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Request</span></code> message with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reject</span></code> message (indicating that a call
has been rejected), and it can respond to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ping</span></code> message with a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Nocall</span></code> message (indicating that the server has never heard of the
caller).</p>
<p>Each request/reply transaction in DCE-RPC takes place in the context of
an <em>activity</em>. An activity is a logical request/reply channel between a
pair of participants. At any given time, there can be only one message
transaction active on a given channel. Like the concurrent logical
channel approach described above, the application programs have to open
multiple channels if they want to have more than one request/reply
transaction between them at the same time. The activity to which a
message belongs is identified by the message’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ActivityId</span></code> field. A
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceNum</span></code> field then distinguishes between calls made as part of
the same activity; it serves the same purpose as SunRPC’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">XID</span></code>
(transaction id) field. Unlike SunRPC, DCE-RPC keeps track of the last
sequence number used as part of a particular activity, so as to ensure
at-most-once semantics. To distinguish between replies sent before and
after a server machine reboots, DCE-RPC uses a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServerBoot</span></code> field to
hold the machine’s boot ID.</p>
<p>Another design choice made in DCE-RPC that differs from SunRPC is the
support of fragmentation and reassembly in the RPC protocol. As noted
above, even if an underlying protocol such as IP provides
fragmentation/reassembly, a more sophisticated algorithm implemented as
part of RPC can result in quicker recovery and reduced bandwidth
consumption when fragments are lost. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FragmentNum</span></code> field uniquely
identifies each fragment that makes up a given request or reply message.
Each DCE-RPC fragment is assigned a unique fragment number (0, 1, 2, 3,
and so on). Both the client and server implement a selective
acknowledgment mechanism, which works as follows. (We describe the
mechanism in terms of a client sending a fragmented request message to
the server; the same mechanism applies when a server sends a fragment
response to the client.)</p>
<p>First, each fragment that makes up the request message contains both a
unique <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FragmentNum</span></code> and a flag indicating whether this packet is a
fragment of a call (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frag</span></code>) or the last fragment of a call (); request
messages that fit in a single packet carry a flag. The server knows it
has received the complete request message when it has the packet and
there are no gaps in the fragment numbers. Second, in response to each
arriving fragment, the server sends a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fack</span></code> (fragment acknowledgment)
message to the client. This acknowledgment identifies the highest
fragment number that the server has successfully received. In other
words, the acknowledgment is cumulative, much like in TCP. In addition,
however, the server selectively acknowledges any higher fragment numbers
it has received out of order. It does so with a bit vector that
identifies these out-of-order fragments relative to the highest in-order
fragment it has received. Finally, the client responds by retransmitting
the missing fragments.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fack"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 144</span></a> illustrates how this all works. Suppose
the server has successfully received fragments up through number 20,
plus fragments 23, 25, and 26. The server responds with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fack</span></code>
that identifies fragment 20 as the highest in-order fragment, plus a
bit-vector (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SelAck</span></code>) with the third (23=20+3), fifth (25=20+5), and
sixth (26=20+6)&nbsp;bits turned on. So as to support an (almost)
arbitrarily long bit vector, the size of the vector (measured in
32-bit words) is given in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SelAckLen</span></code> field.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id10">
<span id="fig-fack"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f05-20-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f05-20-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f05-20-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 144. </span><span class="caption-text">Fragmentation with selective acknowledgments.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Given DCE-RPC’s support for very large messages—the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FragmentNum</span></code>
field is 16&nbsp;bits long, meaning it can support 64K fragments—it is not
appropriate for the protocol to blast all the fragments that make up a
message as fast as it can since doing so might overrun the receiver.
Instead, DCE-RPC implements a flow-control algorithm that is very
similar to TCP’s. Specifically, each <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fack</span></code> message not only
acknowledges received fragments but also informs the sender of how
many fragments it may now send. This is the purpose of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WindowSize</span></code> field in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fack"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 144</span></a>, which serves
exactly the same purpose as TCP’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AdvertisedWindow</span></code> field except it
counts fragments rather than bytes. DCE-RPC also implements a
congestion-control mechanism that is similar to TCP’s. Given the
complexity of congestion control, it is perhaps not surprising that
some RPC protocols avoid it by avoiding fragmentation.</p>
<p>In summary, designers have quite a range of options open to them when
designing an RPC protocol. SunRPC takes the more minimalist approach and
adds relatively little to the underlying transport beyond the essentials
of locating the right procedure and identifying messages. DCE-RPC adds
more functionality, with the possibility of improved performance in some
environments at the cost of greater complexity.</p>

<div class="section" id="grpc">
<h3>gRPC<a class="headerlink" href="#grpc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite its origins in Google, gRPC does not stand for Google RPC. The
“g” stands for something different in each release. For version 1.10 it
stood for “glamorous” and for 1.18 it stood for “goose”. Googlers are
wild and crazy people. Nonetheless, gRPC is popular because it makes
available to everyone—as open source—a decade’s worth of experience
within Google using RPC to build scalable cloud services.</p>
<p>Before getting into the details, there are some major differences
between gRPC and the other two examples we’ve just covered. The biggest
is that gRPC is designed for cloud services rather than the simpler
client/server paradigm that preceded it. The difference is essentially
an extra level of indirection. In the client/server world, the client
invokes a method on a specific server process running on a specific
server machine. One server process is presumed to be enough to serve
calls from all the client processes that might call it.</p>
<p>With cloud services, the client invokes a method on a <em>service</em>, which
in order to support calls from arbitrarily many clients at the same
time, is implemented by a scalable number of server processes, each
potentially running on a different server machine. This is where the
cloud comes into play: datacenters make a seemingly infinite number of
server machines available to scale up cloud services. When we use the
term “scalable” we mean that the number of identical server processes
you elect to create depends on the workload (i.e., the number of clients
that want service at any given time) and that number can be adjusted
dynamically over time. One other detail is that cloud services don’t
typically create a new process, per se, but rather, they launch a new
<em>container</em>, which is essentially a process encapsulated inside an
isolated environment that includes all the software packages the process
needs to run. Docker is today’s canonical example of a container
platform.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id11">
<span id="fig-rpc-service"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide13.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide13.png" src="../_images/Slide13.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 145. </span><span class="caption-text">Using RPC to invoke a scalable cloud service.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Back to the claim that a service is essentially an extra level of
indirection layered on top of a server, all this means is that the
caller identifies the service it wants to invoke, and a <em>load balancer</em>
directs that invocation to one of the many available server processes
(containers) that implement that service, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rpc-service"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
145</span></a>. The load balancer can be implemented in different
ways, including a hardware device, but it is typically implemented by a
proxy process that runs in a virtual machine (also hosted in the cloud)
rather than as a physical appliance.</p>
<p>There is a set of best practices for implementing the actual server code
that eventually responds to that request, and some additional cloud
machinery to create/destroy containers and load balance requests across
those containers. Kubernetes is today’s canonical example of such a
container management system, and the <em>micro-services architecture</em> is
what we call the best practices in building services in this cloud
native manner. Both are interesting topics, but beyond the scope of this
book.</p>
<p>What we are interested in here is transport protocol at the core of
gRPC. Here again, there is a major departure from the two previous
example protocols, not in terms of fundamental problems that need to be
addressed, but in terms of gRPC’s approach to addressing them. In short,
gRPC “outsources” many of the problems to other protocols, leaving gRPC
to essentially package those capabilities in an easy-to-use form. Let’s
look at the details.</p>
<p>First, gRPC runs on top of TCP instead of UDP, which means it outsources
the problems of connection management and reliably transmitting request
and reply messages of arbitrary size. Second, gRPC actually runs on top
of a secured version of TCP called <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS)—a
thin layer that sits above TCP in the protocol stack—which means it
outsources responsibility for securing the communication channel so
adversaries can’t eavesdrop or hijack the message exchange. Third, gRPC
actually, actually runs on top of HTTP/2 (which is itself layered on top
of TCP and TLS), meaning gRPC outsources yet two other problems: (1)
efficiently encoding/compressing binary data into a message, (2)
multiplexing multiple remote procedure calls onto a single TCP
connection. In other words, gRPC encodes the identifier for the remote
method as a URI, the request parameters to the remote method as content
in the HTTP message, and the return value from the remote method in the
HTTP response. The full gRPC stack is depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-grpc-stack"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
146</span></a>, which also includes the language-specific elements.
(One strength of gRPC is the wide set of programming languages it
supports, with only a small subset shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-grpc-stack"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
146</span></a>.)</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id12">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 146. </span><span class="caption-text">gRPC core stacked on top of HTTP, TLS, and TCP and

</div>
<p>We discuss TLS in Chapter 8 (in the context of a broad range of security
topics) and HTTP in Chapter 9 (in the context of what are traditionally
viewed as application level protocols). But we find ourselves in an
interesting dependency loop: RPC is a flavor of transport protocol used
to implement distributed applications, HTTP is an example of an
application-level protocol, and yet gRPC runs on top of HTTP rather than
the other way around.</p>
<p>The short explanation is that layering provides a convenient way for
humans to wrap their heads around complex systems, but what we’re really
trying to do is solve a set of problem (e.g., reliably transfer messages
of arbitrary size, identify senders and recipients, match requests
messages with reply messages, and so on) and the way these solutions get
bundled into protocols, and those protocols then layered on top of each
other, is the consequence of incremental changes over time. You could
argue it’s an historical accident. Had the Internet started with an RPC
mechanism as ubiquitous as TCP, HTTP might have been implemented on top
of it (as might have almost all of the other application-level protocols
described in Chapter 9) and Google would have spent their time improving
<em>that</em> protocol rather than inventing one of their own (as they and
others have been doing with TCP). What happened instead is that the web
became the Internet’s killer app, which meant that its application
protocol (HTTP) became universally supported by the rest of the
Internet’s infrastructure: Firewalls, Load Balancers, Encryption,
Authentication, Compression, and so on. Because all of these network
elements have been designed to work well with HTTP, HTTP has effectively
become the Internet’s universal request/reply transport protocol.</p>
<p>Returning to the unique characteristics of gRPC, the biggest value it
brings to the table is to incorporate <em>streaming</em> into the RPC
mechanism, which is to say, gRPC supports four different request/reply
patterns:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Simple RPC: The client sends a single request message and the server
responds with a single reply message.</li>
<li>Server Streaming RPC: The client sends a single request message and
the server responds with a stream of reply messages. The client
completes once it has all the server’s responses.</li>
<li>Client Streaming RPC: The client sends a stream of requests to the
server, and the server sends back a single response, typically (but
not necessarily) after it has received all the client’s requests.</li>
<li>Bidirectional Streaming RPC: The call is initiated by the client, but
after that, the client and server can read and write requests and
responses in any order; the streams are completely independent.</li>
</ol>
<p>This extra freedom in how the client and server interact means the gRPC
transport protocol needs to send additional metadata and control
messages—in addition to the actual request and reply messages—between
the two peers. Examples include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Error</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Status</span></code> codes (to
indicate success or why something failed), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Timeouts</span></code> (to indicate how
long a client is willing to wait for a response), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PING</span></code> (a keep-alive
notice to indicate that one side or the other is still running), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EOS</span></code>
(end-of-stream notice to indicate that there are no more requests or
responses), and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GOAWAY</span></code> (a notice from servers to clients to indicate
that they will no longer accept any new streams). Unlike many other
protocols in this book, where we show the protocol’s header format, the
way this control information gets passed between the two sides is
largely dictated by the underlying transport protocol, in this case
HTTP/2. For example, as we’ll see in Chapter 9, HTTP already includes a
set of header fields and reply codes that gRPC takes advantage of.</p>
<p>You may want to peruse the HTTP discussion in Chapter 9 before
continuing, but the following is fairly straightforward. A simple RPC
request (with no streaming) might include the following HTTP message
from the client to the server:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>HEADERS (flags = END_HEADERS)

<p>leading to the following response message from the server back to the
client:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>HEADERS (flags = END_HEADERS)
:status = 200
grpc-encoding = gzip
content-type = application/grpc+proto
DATA

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HEADERS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DATA</span></code> are two standard HTTP
control messages, which effectively delineate between “the message’s
header” and “the message’s payload.” Specifically, each line following
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HEADERS</span></code> (but before <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DATA</span></code>) is an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">attribute</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">value</span></code> pair
that makes up the header (think of each line as analogous to a header
field); those pairs that start with colon (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:status</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">200</span></code>)
are part of the HTTP standard (e.g., status <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">200</span></code> indicates
success); and those pairs that do not start with a colon are
gRPC-specific customizations (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grpc-encoding</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">gzip</span></code> indicates
that the data in the message that follows has been compressed using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gzip</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grpc-timeout</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1S</span></code> indicates that the client has set
a one second timeout).</p>
<p>There is one final piece to explain. The header line</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>content-type = application/grpc+proto
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>indicates that the message body (as demarcated by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DATA</span></code> line)
is meaningful only to the application program (i.e., the server
method) that this client is requesting service from. More
specifically, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+proto</span></code> string specifies that the recipient will
be able to interpret the bits in the message according to a <em>Protocol
Buffer</em> (abbreviated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proto</span></code>) interface specification. Protocol
Buffers are gRPC’s way of specifying how the parameters being passed
to the server are encoded into a message, which is in turn used to
generate the stubs that sit between the underlying RPC mechanism and
the actual functions being called (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rpc-stub"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 138</span></a>). This is a topic we’ll take up in Chapter 7.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-micro-service">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">The bottom line is that complex mechanisms like RPC, once packaged as
a monolithic bundle of software (as with SunRPC and DCE-RPC), is
nowadays built by assembling an assortment of smaller pieces, each of
which solves a narrow problem. gRPC is both an example of that
approach, and a tool that enables further adoption of the approach.
The micro-services architecture mentioned earlier in this subsection
applies the “built from small parts” strategy to entire cloud
applications (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Netflix, Yelp, Spotify), where gRPC
is often the communication mechanism used by those small pieces to
exchange messages with each other. <a class="reference internal" href="rtp.html#key-alf"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>
