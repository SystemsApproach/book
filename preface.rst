Preface
=======

It has been nearly ten years since the 5th Edition of *Computer
Networks: A Systems Approach* was published. Much has changed in that
time, most notably, the explosion of the cloud and smartphone apps onto
the scene. In many ways, this is reminiscent of the dramatic affect the
Web was having on the Internet when we published the 1st Edition of the
book in 1996.

The 6th Edition adapts to the times, but keeps the *Systems Approach* as
its north star. In broad strokes, we updated this new edition in three
main ways:

-  We refreshed the examples to reflect the current state of the world.
   This includes deleting anachronisms (e.g., dial-up modem), using
   popular applications (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) to motivate the
   problems being addressed, and updating the numbers to represent the
   state-of-the-art technology (e.g., 10-Gbps Ethernet).

-  We emphasize a historical perspective, connecting the dots between
   the original research that led to the development of technologies
   like multicast, real-time video streaming, and quality-of-service,
   and now-familar cloud applications like GoToMeeting, Netflix, and
   Spotify. This is in keeping with our emphasis on the design process
   and not just the end result, which is especially important today
   since so much the Internet is primarily available in proprietary
   commercial services.

-  We place the Internet in the broader context of the Cloud, and just
   as importantly, in the context of the commerial forces that are
   shaping the Internet and Cloud. This has minimal impact on the
   technical details presented throughout the book, but it is discussed
   in a new *Broader Perspective* section at the end of each chapter. We
   hope one side-effect of this discussion is to foster an appreciation
   for the Internet’s continuous evolution, and the opportunity for
   innovation this represents.

More specifically, the 6th Edition includes the following major changes:

-  New Section 1.6 introduces the recurring *Cloudification* theme.
-  New Section 2.8 describes the *Access Network*, including Passive
   Optical Networks (PON) and 5G’s Radio Access Networks (RAN).
-  Section 3.4 updated to include descriptions of *White-Box Switches*
   and *Software-Defined Networks* (SDN).
-  New Section 3.5 describes *VXLANs* and the role of overlays in the
   Cloud.
-  New Section 4.5 describes how the *Cloud* impacts the Internet’s
   structure.
-  Section 5.3 expanded to include a description of *gRPC*.
-  Sections 6.3 and 6.4 updated to include descriptions of *TCP CUBIC,
   DCTCP,* and *BBR*.
-  Section 6.4 expanded to include a description of *Active Queue
   Management* (AQM).
-  Section 7.1 expanded to include a desciption of *Protocol Buffers*.
-  Section 7.2 expanded to include a desciption of *HTTP Adaptive
   Streaming*.
-  New Section 8.1 introduces the duality of *Threats* and *Trust*.
-  New Section 8.6 describes *Decentralized Identity Management* and the
   role of *Blockchains*.
-  Section 9.1 updated to include a description of *HTTP/2*, along with
   a discussion of *REST*, *gRPC*, and *Cloud Services*.
-  Section 9.3 expaned to include a description of modern *Network
   Management Systems* including the use of *OpenConfig* and *gNMI*.
