# Preface 

This site contains source text for *Computer Networks: A Systems
Approach*, now available under terms of the [Creative Commons
(CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)
license. The community is invited to contribute corrections,
improvements, updates, and new material under the same terms.

Like many open source software projects, this one has been seeded
with once restricted content: the 5th edition of *Peterson and Davie*,
copyrighted by Elsevier. Our hope is that open sourcing this material
will both make it widely available and serve as an attractor for new
content: updating what's already there, expanding it to cover new
topics, and augmenting the text with additional teaching collateral.

We will initially play an editorial role (curating and wordsmithing)
for contributions that come back, but our plan is to share ownership
of the project with others committed to its success.

And if you make use of this work, the attribution should include
the following information:

## Read the Book

An online version of the book is published at
[https://book.systemsapproach.org](https://book.systemsapproach.org).

## Build the Book

The source content is organized as a git repository per chapter, each of
which focuses on a major networking topic (e.g., *Internetworking*,
*Congestion Control*). A "root" repo
([this one](https://github.com/SystemsApproach/book)) contains the
gitbook files that can be used to create a full book. To build a
web-viewable version, you first need to install a couple packages:

* [Gitbook Toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html)
* [Node.js Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Then do the following to download the source:

```shell
mkdir ~/systemsapproach
cd ~/systemsapproach
git clone https://github.com/systemsapproach/book.git
cd book
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To build a web version of the book, simply type:

```shell
make
```

If all goes well, you will be able to view the book in your browser at
`localhost:4000`. (If all doesn't go well, you might try typing `make`
a second time.)

You can also build other versions of the book (e.g., pdf, ebook), but
doing so requires installing other packages, as documented on the
[GitBook Toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/ebook.html) site.

## How to Contribute

We hope that if you use this material, you are also willing to
contribute back to it. If you are new to open source, you might check
out this [How to Contribute to Open
Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide.
Among other things, you'll learn about posting *Issues* that you'd
like to see addressed, and issuing *Pull Requests* to merge your
improvements back into GitHub.

If you do want to contribute either patches or new material, you will
need to sign a [Contributor Licensing Agreement
(CLA)](https://github.com/SystemsApproach/book/blob/master/CLA.md).
You'll be prompted to sign the CLA the first time you make a pull request.

The CLA is pretty straightforward: it establishes that (a) you have
the right to contribute what you're contributing, and (b) what you
contribute is available to everyone else under the same
[CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) terms as
the existing content. The CLA is a little unusual in that it explicitly
calls out Elsevier's rights (which are the same as everyone's), but
this does signal their intent to continue publishing textbooks based
on the material.

You should also familiarize yourself with the [guidelines for
contributing](https://github.com/SystemsApproach/book/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
As a first step,  we recommend you check to see if any new text
you'd like to submit passes our `MarkDownLint` test. To do this,
run

```shell
cd ~/systemsapproach
make lint
```

If you'd like to contribute and are looking for something that needs
attention, see the current
[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/SystemsApproach/projects/).
We'd also like to expand the set of topics/chapters beyond the initial
set inherited from the 5th edition, so if you have ideas, we'd love to
hear from you. Send email to `discuss@systemsapproach.org`, or better
yet, [join the
forum](https://groups.google.com/a/systemsapproach.org/forum/#!forum/discuss).

Finally, in as much as this is an on-going effort, we will try to record
and track our
[progress](https://github.com/SystemsApproach/book/blob/master/status.md).
For now, think of this as a poor-man's release notes.

## Join Us

We hope you've gotten value out of *Computer Networks: A Systems
Approach* over the years, and we're eager to have you join us in this
new venture.
